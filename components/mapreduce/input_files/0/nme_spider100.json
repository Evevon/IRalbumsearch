Jackson denied any wrongdoing until his death in 2009.Ross has now tweeted her thoughts on Jackson after the film\u2019s release, writing: \u201cThis is what\u2019s on my heart this morning. I believe and trust that Michael Jackson was and is A magnificent incredible force to me and to many others.\u201dShe added in a reference to her 1965 hit with The Supremes, writing: \u201cSTOP IN THE NAME OF LOVE\u201d You can see the tweet below.Meanwhile, Barbra Streisand has responded to the backlash over her comments on the Jackson abuse allegations.Streisand made the controversial comments in a recent interview with The Times. When asked about the allegations, Streisand said she \u201cabsolutely\u201d believed Robson and Safechuck adding, \u201cthat was too painful.\u201dShe continued: \u201c[Jackson\u2019s] sexual needs were his sexual needs, coming from whatever childhood he has or whatever DNA he has\u2026You can say \u2018molested\u2019, but those children, as you heard them say, they were thrilled to be there. They both married and they both have children, so it didn\u2019t kill them.\u201dAsked if she was angry by Jackson\u2019s alleged actions, Streisand said: \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of feelings. I feel bad for the children. I feel bad for him. I blame, I guess, the parents, who would allow their children to sleep with him.\u201cWhy would Michael need these little children dressed like him and in the shows and dancing and the hats?\u201dThe comments received a backlash on social media from many, including the director of the documentary, Dan Reed. On Twitter, Reed wrote: \u201c\u2018It didn\u2019t kill them\u2019 @BarbaraStreisand did you really say that?!\u201dNow, Streisand has released a statement to add clarity to the views she shared \u2013 saying she has \u201cnothing but sympathy\u201d for Robson and Safechuck.\u201cTo be crystal clear, there is no situation or circumstance where it is OK for the innocence of children to be taken advantage of by anyone,\u201d the statement begins. \u201cThe stories these two young men shared were painful to hear, and I feel nothing but sympathy for them.\u201d\u201cThe single most important role of being a parent is to protect their children,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the parents of the two young men were also victimized and seduced by fame and fantasy.\u201d", "pptitle": ["diana", "ross", "defend", "michael", "jackson", "leav", "neverland"]}
