I\u2019m going to be a devil today and not ask you any questions. I\u2019m certain that among the many messages, there will be those about how you embrace the new, and how you\u2019ve freed so many artists \u2013 and this is of course true.\u201cLike everyone else, I\u2019d like to thank you for all the years and especially your generosity of spirit when it comes to other artists. I\u2019ve been the beneficiary on more than one occasion, let me tell you.\u201dHe added: \u201cSo have a wonderful birthday. By the way, mine\u2019s the day after yours; so I\u2019ll have a drink to you on the other side of midnight.\u201dClearly touched as his voice begins to crack, Bowie then responded: \u201cThat\u2019s amazing. I see God in the window. He really got to me there, I\u2019m afraid. I think he\u2019s probably been my idol since I was a kid. That\u2019s really moved me. I want a copy of that! Thank you very much.\u201dWalker was huge influence countless other artists, including the the likes of Radiohead, Arctic Monkeys, Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker, The Divine Comedy and many more.Paying tribute on Twitter, Thom Yorke wrote: \u201cSo very sad to hear that Scott Walker has passed away, he was a huge influence on Radiohead and myself, showing me how i could use my voice and words. Met him once at Meltdown, such a kind gentle outsider. He will be very missed.\u201d", "pptitle": ["fan", "share", "beauti", "birthday", "messag", "scott", "walker", "david", "bowi"]}
