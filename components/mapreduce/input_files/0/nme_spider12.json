We just played music for three weeks. And it\u2019s great. I know everyone says that. But it really is fucking great.\u201dAdmitting that the new album isn\u2019t really festival friendly material, Smith revealed it could potentially be a triple disc affair.\u201cIt\u2019s so dark. It\u2019s incredibly intense,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe songs are like 10 minutes, 12 minutes long. We recorded 19 songs. So I have no idea what to do now. The others are saying, \u2018triple album!\u2019 I\u2019m saying, no let\u2019s not. I\u2019ll pick six or maybe eight songs and do like a single album. But I think I will delight our hardcore fans. And probably really, really infuriate everyone else. At my age, I\u2019m still doom and gloom.\u201dHe added that the band plan to finish the album \u201cbefore we start in the summer, and it\u2019ll be mixed through the summer. And then so releasee date, I don\u2019t know, October? Halloween! Come on!\u201dSmith also discussed plans to play some shows in the US to celebrate the 30th anniversary of 1989 album \u2018Disintegration\u2019.\u201cWe\u2019re holding home theaters in New York and Los Angeles,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I kind of feel like we should do it in a bigger venue. I\u2019d like to a big show with it, really. It\u2019s a bigger album. I think when we did the first three albums we did three nights at the Beacon in New York. It was much more punky. We were trying to recreate that vibe. But I think \u2018Disintegration\u2019 is just big. So we need to do somewhere that\u2019s just big. But probably about Christmas time we\u2019ll come back.\u201dMeanwhile, The Cure were confirmed to be headlining this year\u2019s Glastonbury Festival earlier this month (March 15). They join Stormzy and The Killers at the top of a bill that also includes the likes of Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Liam Gallagher, Tame Impala, Vampire Weekend, Bastille, Billie Eilish, and more.", "pptitle": ["dark", "incred", "intens", "cure", "share", "detail", "new", "album"]}
