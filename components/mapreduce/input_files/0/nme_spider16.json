He is said to have even given a young George Harrison driving lessons.Writing about his experiences with the band in his autobiography, \u2018Standing in the Wings: The Beatles, Brian Epstein and Me\u2019, Flannery said:\u00a0\u201cIt was a very exciting time. The Beatles were more with me than Brian in the early days.\u201dThe famous Cavern Club paid tribute, writing: \u201cWe are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Joe Flannery, a lifelong friend and business associate of Brian Epstein and friend of The Cavern Club.\u00a0Everyone at The Cavern, Beatleweek and all who met him over the years will miss him dearly and our thoughts are with his family.\u201dMayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, tweeted: \u201cSad to hear of the passing of my dear friend Joe Flannery a real gentleman so influential in the Liverpool music scene, he was a Beatles historian and ambassador for our City.

He was 17-years-old at the time.", "pptitle": ["tribut", "pour", "secret", "beatl", "joe", "flanneri", "die"]}
