Charlie Watts is playing his arse off! He\u2019s absolutely amazing. It\u2019s indescribable to find a drummer like Charlie Watts, exceptionally brilliant.\u201d\u201cI can never praise Charlie enough and I can praise Mick Jagger 99% of the time,\u201d Richards added, turning his attention to the singer.\u201cMick knows what I mean and he\u2019ll say the same about me. Things happen between Mick and me because it\u2019s just two guys working together. You only hear about the odd bust-up. I love the man 99% of the time.\u201dRichards also admitted that his first experience of being a solo artist with \u2018Talk Is Cheap\u2019 30 years ago gave him a new-found appreciation for Jagger\u2019s band-leading duties.\n\u201cIt was my first time fronting the whole thing,\u201d he recalled. \u201cUsually, this is Mick\u2019s job and suddenly I understood a lot more about the dynamics of being a frontman.\u201cI understood the pressure. My feelings towards Mick became, \u2018Yeah, I get it, man.\u2019\u201dEarlier this month, The Rolling Stones announced a new compilation album. \u2018Honk\u2019 will be released in April, and will feature recent live recordings from the band\u2019s tours.", "pptitle": ["keith", "richard", "relationship", "mick", "jagger", "love", "man", "99", "time"]}
