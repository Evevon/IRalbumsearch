Soon after, the musician launches into the dark narrative of the song.In a video packed with bold imagery, the musician can be seen sporting a bloody nose on numerous occasions and dancing wildly before things take a darker turn in the final verse of the song.You can watch the video here:\n\u2018Bad Guy\u2019 is the second single taken from her debut, \u2018When We All Fall Asleep, Where do we Go?\u2019\u00a0In a five star review of the album,\u00a0NME\u00a0wrote:\u00a0\u201c\u2018When We All Fall Asleep\u2026\u2019 ticks all the boxes for a memorable and game-changing debut album. It\u2019s enjoyable and familiar, but retains Billie\u2019s disruptive streak.\u201cIt\u2019s a brave and resounding first step for an artist with bags of potential and over the next decade, you\u2019ll no doubt see popular music scrabbling to try and replicate what this album does on every level. There\u2019ll always be copycats, as Billie noted on her 2017 song of the same name, but none will be able to reach these heights any time soon.\u201dMeanwhile, the singer recently told NME how she made the strange video for \u2018When The Party\u2019s Over\u2019. She revealed it was inspired by a drawing given to her by a fan in which her eyes were black and had black ink dripping down from them.\u201cI just stared at it and I feel like I got star-struck by this image, this drawing of me,\u201d Eilish said. Of the black substance used in the video, she explained: \u201cThe glass of, like, black shit was Xanthan gum mixed with charcoal water, but for that thickness. But I still had to take maybe like four swallows. Oh my god, it was such a long fucking day, but it turned out so perfect.\u201dEilish\u2019s debut album \u2018When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\u2019 is out now.", "pptitle": ["watch", "billi", "eilish", "bold", "surreal", "new", "video", "bad", "guy"]}
