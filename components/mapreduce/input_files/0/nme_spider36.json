The Spider-Man spin-off film, which stars Jared Leto and Matt Smith, is currently being filmed in the city, although the former has not yet been spotted on set. The film crew have brought yellow taxis, blue US Mail postboxes and newsstands with copies of USA Today and the New York Times to areas including Stevenson Square and Oldham Street. A fake subway station called Front Street has also been built, while hot dog stands and New York buses have been spotted in the city.According to the Manchester Evening News, a crowd had gathered at the location. One told the paper earlier this week: \u201cThere\u2019s make up teams hanging around and people setting up New York street signs and there\u2019s a blue New York bus parked in Stevenson Square. There must be a few hundred people here watching, but they haven\u2019t started filming yet. It\u2019s really interesting to see.\u201dLeto plays the titular villain Dr. Michael Morbius, who transforms from a scientist into a vampire after trying to treat himself for a rare blood disease. Smith plays another villain in Loxias Crown, while True Detective\u2019s Adria Arjona will appear as Morbius\u2019 fianc\u00e9e, Martine Bancroft.The rest of the cast is yet to be confirmed, but Daniel Espinosa (Life, Safe House) has been announced as its director. Morbius is due for release on July 31, 2020. Earlier this month, Leto shared the first photo from the set of the spin-off movie. In the picture, the actor could be seen behind a clapperboard with the film\u2019s title on it.
