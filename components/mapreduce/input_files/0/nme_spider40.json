Artists are eligible for inclusion 25 years after the release of their first record. The New York hip-hop group have been eligible since 2017. Speaking to Rolling Stone, RZA said he believed Wu-Tang Clan belonged in the institution. \u201cI think we should [get in], and I do care,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may take some time to get in there. I think it\u2019s good for us and I think it\u2019s good for rock and roll\u00a0because hip-hop is a form of music that grabs from every genre, but definitely grabs from rock and roll.\u201dHe continued to explain the similarities between rock music and hip-hop, saying: \u201cRock and roll has a certain spirit; it was the spirit of the sixties and seventies youth. \u201cHip-hop is the eighties, nineties, up to now \u2013 the youth. It\u2019s called hip-hop, but it\u2019s in the same spirit of rock & roll at the end of the day. Lyrical stories, music, unorthodox, dissonant sometimes, energetic \u2013 all the things that rock is and was hip-hop embodies.\u201dRZA added that Wu-Tang\u2019s classic single \u2018Bring Da Ruckus\u2019 highlighted those similarities, explaining that while he \u201cthought he was making hip-hop shit\u201d, he was actually producing something with a \u201cmotherfucking rock and roll groove.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how the fuck I did that,\u201d he said. \u201cI go back and listen to some of The Beatles\u2019 progressions and some of Zeppelin\u2019s progressions and movements, like, okay, I was on some shit, though.\u201dThe 2019 Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame induction is due to take place on Friday (March 27) at Barclays Center in New York.\u00a0Radiohead, Def Leppard, Janet Jackson, The Zombies, The Cure, Stevie Nicks, and Roxy Music are all set to be inducted.
