See it first on NME.com below.The series focuses on the creation of the Manchester band\u2019s 1981 debut, which was released in the year following the demise of\u00a0Joy Division: the band that brought about New Order\u2019s incarnation.While the first and second episodes focused respectively on the experiences of Bernard Sumner and guitarist Gillian Gilbert, the final chapter sees drummer Stephen Morris providing his take on things.\u201cWho wants to come and see the band that used to be Joy Division? Nobody,\u201d jokes Morris as he recalls the band\u2019s formative period.\u201cI don\u2019t know who to feel sorry for. Us or the audience. There was a couple of gigs in America where I\u2019m sure I heard someone say, \u2018Which one\u2019s the dead guy?'\u201dWatch in full below as Morris discusses the band\u2019s early struggles in deciding on a vocalist. He says Bernard Sumner was \u201cquite good\u201d because he sang in \u201ca half-hearted, disinterested way that was quite charming\u201d.\n\u2018Movement\u2019 is set to\u00a0be reissued on vinyl and CD, boasting tonnes of previously unreleased cuts, demos, and live performances.
