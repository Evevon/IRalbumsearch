We were initially a little rusty but also nostalgic playing songs that have been around since we were teenagers. More than anything it just felt great to be in the same room playing again. It made us realise what a good thing we have and has given us renewed energy and enthusiasm for the future.The joy we were getting out of playing the old songs seemed to naturally lead us onto working on new material, so we\u2019re becoming immersed in that as we speak. Hopefully it won\u2019t be too long before we have something new for you guys to hear.\u201d", "pptitle": ["bombay", "bicycl", "club", "record", "new", "album"]}
