Subsequent scans showed that Travers had two tumours, and he\u2019ll now undergo surgery on Thursday (March 28) \u2013 the day before the band begin their tour in Portsmouth.\u201cIt is with great regret that I shall be unable to join my band mates in UB40 on our 40th anniversary tour, the guys have worked incredibly hard to perfect the songs in preparation for the live premier of our new album \u2018For the Many\u2019,\u201d Travers said in a statement. \u201cThey sound great, but I shall be there in spirit, cheering them on from my convalescence and thinking of all the wonderful people out there who have supported us for the last 40 years, who I am now incredibly proud to count as friends.\u201cI\u2019ve had a great life with no regrets and have absolutely nothing to add to a bucket list except getting over this and getting back to the thing I love, playing music to anyone who wants to listen and expressing myself through painting and sculpture. It\u2019s been a huge privilege and I thank you all for the opportunity to \u2018live the dream\u2019.\u201dThe band confirmed that the tour will still be going ahead, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re deeply saddened that Brian, our lifelong friend and founding member of UB40, is unable to join us for our celebratory UK tour.
