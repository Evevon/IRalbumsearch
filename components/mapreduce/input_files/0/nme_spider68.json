It\u2019s interesting.\u201cThey\u2019ve been such a successful band that the narrative that gets portrayed of them in the press is \u2018Oh, they must be very middle of the road. Whether you love the band or not, each album is an experimentation and markedly different from the last one. Just like a band like Radiohead. They haven\u2019t written a \u2018Kid A\u2019 yet where their entire fanbase goes \u2018What the fuck is this?\u2019, but I feel like if you play the first one then the most recent, it\u2019s not a foregone conclusion.\u201cThey always want to be challenging themselves and surprising other people \u2013 that\u2019s why they work with people like Brian Eno. In that sense, I\u2019m sure whatever they do next will surprise people.\u201d", "pptitle": ["coldplay", "chri", "martin", "file", "restrain", "order", "stalker", "think", "date"]}
