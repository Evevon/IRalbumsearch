The melodies and words are running around in my head, so excuse this letter if it\u2019s kind of scrambled.\u201dHe added: \u201cYou asked about love, Mack, and maybe that\u2019s what love is right there \u2013 maybe\u00a0songs\u00a0are the parlance of love. Maybe that\u2019s what we have conceived them for \u2013 to give a voice to this strange, inscrutable feeling that tears away at us, all our lives.\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe some songs are the embodiment of love itself and that\u2019s why they move us so deeply.\u201cThey are simple, plainspoken, incendiary devices that bomb the heart to pieces \u2013 something other art forms can\u2019t do with the same sudden and frightening precision.\u201dIntroducing the list, he explained: \u201cHere is a list of ten of my most treasured love songs \u2013 old, sad songs mostly, and sentimental too, that have travelled with me through the years, holding sway over my world and never failing to rescue me. They are just small unassuming love bombs, but dear Luiza, as important as anything can ever be.\u201dYou can listen to the songs listed by Cave in full below in no particular order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["listen", "nick", "cave", "favourit", "love", "song"]}
