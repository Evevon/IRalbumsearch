He added: \u201cBut [I] had to ask myself, \u201cWhy that song? That slightly goofy Tex-Mex song? Why that one?\u201d\u00a0We\u2019ll never know.\u201dHe went on to say he was a \u201chuge fan\u201d of the group and that they \u201crichly deserve this honour\u201d because of \u201cthe quality and constant innovation\u201d of their work and \u201ctheir innovations in how they release their work\u2026they\u2019re creative and smart\u2026a rare and inspiring combination.\u201dByrne added: \u201cHere\u2019s a tidbit: Radio 1 in the UK refused to play their song \u2018Creep\u2019 because they found it too depressing. But then it started getting played elsewhere all over the world, and, well, the rest\u2026\u201cAnd another: Capitol Records felt that what many consider to be their masterpiece, \u2018OK Computer\u2019, was career suicide and adjusted their release and marketing plan accordingly. It eventually went to Number 1 in the UK. \u2018Paranoid Android,\u2019 from that album, was considered the new \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody,\u2019 whatever that means. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the movie, and seeing who will play Thom.\u201dYou can watch Byrne\u2019s speech in full here:\nByrne spoke about his love for Radiohead\u2019s seminal albums, \u2018Kid A\u2019 and \u2018In Rainbows\u2019, saying he was a fan of both their experimentation and creativity.He added: \u201cMusic that at one point sounded radical and on the edge now felt completely natural\u2026Their last record, \u2018Moon-Shaped Pool\u2019, sounded very cinematic, sounded like a movie in your head.\u00a0They\u2019ve both changed our idea of what popular music can be and how it can be released and marketed to us. For those things, I am honoured to\u00a0induct Radiohead into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\u201dThe award was collected by Radiohead\u2019s Ed O\u2019Brien and Phillip Selway. Accepting the award, Selway said: \u201cThis is a real honor. And it\u2019s particularly special that David Byrne has inducted us. As David said, we borrowed a band name from him 30 years ago and luckily for us he hasn\u2019t asked for it back yet.\u201cI\u2019d just like to say a little bit about what being in Radiohead means to me. It can be awkward and challenging sometimes. But I guess that\u2019s what kept us all interested for the past three decades. I\u2019m beyond proud of what the five of us have achieved together, and I know that Radiohead wouldn\u2019t have become what it is without the five of us.\u201dO\u2019Brien added: \u201cI just want to say this is such a beautifully surreal evening for us and it\u2019s very far from where we come from. But thank you for inviting us, inducting us into this Hall of Fame. It is a big fucking deal. I wish the others could be here because they would be feeling it.\u201c\u2026I\u00a0want to thank [the others] for their integrity, their authenticity, their commitment\u2026I also want to thank them for the musicians they are. That thing when we play together; that collective sound that we make. Some of the nights we have in the rehearsal studio where they\u2019re like transcendental moments.\u201dBack in January, frontman\u00a0Thom Yorke\u00a0confirmed that he didn\u2019t intend to attend the band\u2019s induction ceremony for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.In June 2017, Jonny Greenwood also told Rolling Stone that he \u201cdidn\u2019t care\u201d about Radiohead\u2019s possible nomination that year. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a cultural thing that I really don\u2019t understand. I mean, from the outside it looks like\u2026 it\u2019s quite a self-regarding profession anyway. And anything that heightens that just makes me feel even more uncomfortable.\u201d", "pptitle": ["watch", "david", "byrn", "pay", "tribut", "radiohead", "induct", "rock", "roll", "hall", "fame"]}
