Trump administration, anti-Trump songs aren\u2019t exactly uncommon, but very few take dead aim at the openly racist politics surrounding the MAGA movement. That alone makes \u201cThis Land\u201d bracing, but having these sentiments sung by Gary Clark Jr.\u2014an artist who has until now studiously avoided making grand statements\u2014is all the more powerful: It feels like the times have pushed the blues guitarist to take a stand.\nAccording to Clark, it wasn\u2019t merely the overall political climate that pushed him to write \u201cThis Land,\u201d it was a specific incident with a new neighbor\u2014one who couldn\u2019t believe a young black man could own a sprawling ranch just outside of Austin. Gary Clark Jr. channeled his anger over this casual racism into a dose of fury so controlled, its origin becomes obscured\u2014it becomes a proper blues song, in other words, where the specific is turned into something universal.\nIronically, \u201cThis Land\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily a harbinger for the rest of This Land, the Texas bluesman\u2019s third studio album. Apart from \u201cFeed the Babies,\u201d which offers a vague plea for growth and understanding, there isn\u2019t another song that directly confronts a societal woe, nor is there much anger flowing through its other 15 songs. What \u201cThis Land\u201d does indicate is how Clark no longer feels restricted by the confining dictates of modern blues.\nEven before the 2012 release of his debut, Blak and Blu, Clark called the blues world his home, cutting his teeth at the legendary Austin club Antone\u2019s\u2014the same place where Stevie Ray Vaughan began his rise to stardom. Often, it seemed as if Clark had stepped into SRV\u2019s shoes: They shared an idol in Jimi Hendrix, a preternatural gift for mimicry (both guitarists could emulate their heroes at a drop of a hat), and an instinct to crank amplifiers to their limits. Clark\u2019s tendency to release live albums after a studio set was a tacit admission that what his audience really wanted to hear was solo after solo\u2014an acknowledgment that many modern blues fans prize pyrotechnics over songs.\nThere is plenty of guitar on This Land\u2014\u201cHighway 71\u201d is nothing but an extended solo\u2014but six-string prowess seems a secondary concern for Clark this time around; he\u2019s happy to use the instrument for texture, not shredding. Blues also takes a backseat on This Land. It\u2019s there on the fringes, informing the chord changes and coloring the arrangements, happily existing as coda on the finger-picked \u201cDirty Dishes Blues\u201d and on the boozy stumble \u201cThe Governor,\u201d but it\u2019s not at the forefront. Instead, Clark draws deeply from the legacies of Prince and Curtis Mayfield, punctuating his slow-burning ballads, densely colored soul, and churning psychedelia with elongated reggae jams (\u201cFeeling Like a Million\u201d) and blasts of burning rock\u2019n\u2019roll (\u201cGotta Get Into Something\u201d). Hints of these sounds could be heard on Clark\u2019s previous album, The Story of Sonny Boy Slim\u2014opening track \u201cThe Healing\u201d and \u201cWings\u201d were built upon drum loops, and \u201cStar\u201d and \u201cCan\u2019t Sleep\u201d feigned funk\u2014but on This Land, these interests don\u2019t play as accoutrements: They\u2019re the entire reason the album exists.\nUsually, Clark works these lush, layered sounds into a sharply executed piece of roots-pop, enlivening retro cliches through keen hooks and imaginative juxtapositions: \u201cWhen I\u2019m Gone\u201d melds an easy Windy City groove to a touch of Latin rumble, \u201cDon\u2019t Wait Til Tomorrow\u201d threads drum loops and samples through its soulful plea. Sometimes Clark and co-producer Jacob Sciba rely on sound over song\u2014it\u2019s possible to envision \u201cGot to Get Up\u201d as an anthem designed to revive flagging audience interest at the tail end of a long set\u2014yet that\u2019s ultimately to the album\u2019s benefit, since their studio concoctions feel more kinetic than a Clark concert. Even better, This Land is the first place where Gary Clark Jr. doesn\u2019t appear hemmed in by the past. The album may be informed by old sounds and forms, yet these familiar tropes feel fresh thanks to Clark\u2019s idiosyncratic splicing\u2014a cross-cultural, pan-genre sensibility that speaks to the modern world as a whole, just as \u201cThis Land\u201d speaks to this individual moment.\n", "pptitle": ["land"]}
