On her debut album, Death Becomes Her, she adds neck-snapping rap to the production, using her voice as a tool in her quest to dislodge gender binaries and power hierarchies. A black trans woman, she is Hyperdub\u2019s first emerging pop star, a shape-shifting artist who is just as comfortable toying with experimental sounds as she is invoking Missy Elliott. On Death Becomes Her, Angel-Ho beautifully transmutes any past anguish into a colorful network of global sonics, a bold statement of trans femininity, and a rallying cry for resistance. At once, Angel-Ho shatters binaries and encompasses dualities.\nThe apocalyptic drums and crashing samples of \u201cMuse to You\u201d recall the most brutal, jagged beats from electronic envelope-pushers Rabit and Arca, both Angel-Ho collaborators. But these tracks are clearly meant for dancing, their industrial samples fluttering over pulsating grooves. And when Angel-Ho spits searing bars over these beats, as on \u201cPose,\u201d she moves toward queer rappers Le1f and Mykki Blanco, both responsible for breaking barriers in their respective hip-hop scenes.\nAngel-Ho also pulls the past into this challenging moment, referencing and reflecting turn-of-the-millenium R&B. She mirrors the cadence of Aaliyah\u2019s \u201cTry Again\u201d during \u201cLive\u201d and interpolates Lumidee\u2019s international hit \u201cNever Leave You\u201d (which itself incorporates the Diwali Riddim) for \u201cPose.\u201d All these disparate sources stem from the African diaspora, collectively encompassing a broader experience shared by queer people of color around the world. Flipping meanings of familiar songs with her electrifying delivery, Angel-Ho bends old pop tropes, too. She repurposes the classic hook of the Bee Gees\u2019 \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d for \u201cLive,\u201d a pointed decision considering that trans people are persecuted at staggering rates around the globe. Angel-Ho screeches the lyrics with urgency, the contrast with the Gibbs\u2019 cool white falsettos high. Elsewhere, she triumphantly yells \u201cNotorious!,\u201d referencing the Duran Duran song that Biggie famously sampled. It becomes a queenly declaration.\nAngel-Ho finds power from putting herself on a pedestal, constantly comparing herself to iconic women. She\u2019s \u201csymphonically Bj\u00f6rk\u201d or dancing around like Britney. Marilyn Monroe wishes she were her, she boasts. But underneath the desire to be revered and idolized is the need to be respected. During \u201cMuse to You,\u201d over a pounding house beat, Angel-Ho regally announces, \u201cNo longer beaten and abused/You are the girl who paid her dues/You are the muse.\u201d It echoes a sentiment shared by many trans women who can only avoid being targeted for violence when they publicly pass as a cis woman, fueling their aspirations to embody a female fantasy.\nThis idea is the basis of \u201cLike a Girl,\u201d whose sing-song chorus reiterates the simple sentiment of infinite pop songs before it: \u201cI can be your girl/In this lonely world.\u201d Sung by Angel-Ho, though, it becomes a radical statement in the face of the those who don\u2019t believe that trans womanhood deserves to be regarded as womanhood. If she wants to be \u201cyour girl,\u201d she can.\n", "pptitle": ["death"]}
