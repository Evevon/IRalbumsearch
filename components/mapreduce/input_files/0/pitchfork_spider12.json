But in an interview conducted on the eve of the album\u2019s release, Segall suggested the album represented the closing of a chapter. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve barely even tapped anything,\u201d he said, before revealing a desire to experiment with electronic production and make a hip-hop album. It remains to be seen whether Ty actually follows through on the transformation into MC Lil T. But if Segall is indeed laying his rocker id to rest for a while, Deforming Lobes is the blaze of glory in which it\u2019s going out.\nDeforming Lobes was recorded live by Steve Albini during Segall\u2019s three-night stint at Los Angeles\u2019 Teragram Ballroom in January 2018, but it disavows the rules of the typical live album. It has no ambition to document the concerts as they happened\u2014the crowd noise has been largely sucked out of Albini\u2019s mixes, to the point where it sometimes feels like you\u2019re listening in on a private rehearsal rather than a performance before a crowd of several hundred people. Its eight selections have been cherry-picked from what were much more sprawling and eclectic set lists and radically resequenced. And with few exceptions, these are not Segall\u2019s signature songs, so it\u2019s not like Deforming Lobes is meant to serve as some sort of de facto greatest-hits overview. There aren\u2019t even any Freedom\u2019s Goblin tracks here to frame this particular moment in Segall\u2019s career.\nBut there is one crucial quality that connects Deforming Lobes\u2019 random assortment of deep cuts, covers, and early nuggets. And that\u2019s the pulverizing power of the Freedom Band, the four-piece unit\u2014bassist Mikal Cronin, guitarist Emmett Kelly, keyboardist Ben Boye, and drummer Charlie Moothart\u2014that has backed Segall onstage since 2016, and has pushed him to new levels of heaviness and face-melting gnarliness in concert, even as his songwriting on record has become more refined. As such, Deforming Lobes\u2019 closest antecedent would be The Who\u2019s original, equally compact Live at Leeds, where the purpose is less about highlighting the set-list staples than showcasing the band in their most primal, exploratory state.\nYou can feel the Freedom Band\u2019s imposing presence from the very first note\u2014as an announcer introduces the band, the opening chord of \u201cWarm Hands\u201d comes rudely crashing in like a safe dropped from a high rise before he can even finish uttering Segall\u2019s name. Taken from Segall\u2019s self-titled 2017 release, the nine-minute prog-punk suite serves as Deforming Lobes\u2019 fearsome point-of-no-return gateway, an electric-fence barrier erected to ward off casual fans who prefer Segall\u2019s more playful, melodic side. And where the original eventually dissolves into a tranquil pool of noodly Santana solos, the Freedom Band redirect it toward a turbulent, shredding climax.\nThat combination of ferocity and fluidity makes Deforming Lobes distinct from anything in Segall\u2019s bottomless catalog. The Freedom Band\u2019s adrenalizing properties are most deeply felt on the songs taken from 2016\u2019s Emotional Mugger, Segall\u2019s demented detour into alien glam-rock. Here, the Morse-code fuzz, tinfoil-chewing guitar frequencies, and stiff robotic rhythms of \u201cSquealer\u201d and \u201cBreakfast Eggs\u201d give way to pure punk-metal muscle, while Segall invests their whimsical vocals with a throat-ravaging theatricality. But some Deforming Lobes revisions simply exist to give Segall\u2019s trashy-sounding early recordings a welcome bottom-end boost\u2014he deviously stretches out the quiet intro to the 2009-era standard \u201cFinger,\u201d presumably to maximize the shock-and-awe factor when the band finally kicks into a psych-sludge groove several tons heavier than the original.\nAt all three of his Teragram shows, Segall encored with a rendition of the Groundhogs\u2019 1971 asphalt-ripping classic \u201cCherry Red,\u201d a song he first covered for a 2011 single. Where Segall tends to corrupt his classic-rock covers with his manic energy\u2014often paring them down and rearranging them as he sees fit\u2014the \u201cCherry Red\u201d featured here is almost too reverential by his standards, with Segall dutifully mimicking Tony McPhee\u2019s high-pitched melody lines while the band seems extra-careful not to upset the song\u2019s steady hypno-chug groove. But Deforming Lobes smartly repositions \u201cCherry Red\u201d as a penultimate reprieve that lets you catch your breath before the album\u2019s glorious finale: a version of \u201cLove Fuzz\u201d that stretches out the three-minute Twins thrasher into Segall\u2019s very own \u201cWon\u2019t Get Fooled Again,\u201d complete with a dramatic oscillating-organ breakdown that tees up one last blitzkrieg blast. Over his career, Segall has come up with different ways to wave goodbye and say goodnight, but none as emphatic as this.\n", "pptitle": ["deform", "lobe"]}
