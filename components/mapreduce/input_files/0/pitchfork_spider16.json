When the conservative regime shuttered trans brothels and banned performances by trans artists, Turkish transgender singer B\u00fclent Ersoy began her sexual reassignment process, publicly revealing her new body at a national trade show. Subject to intense discrimination, Ersoy attempted suicide before fleeing to Germany, where she was able to rebuild her career in a place where her choices were accepted and understood.\nThis history of fascistic bodily control looms over the work of the Bay Area DJ, producer, and multidisciplinary artist 8ULENTINA, named after Ersoy. Along with Lara Sarkissian, aka FOOZOOL, 8ULENTINA co-founded Oakland\u2019s Club Chai,\u00a0a collective that cultivates safe spaces for trans and women-identifying individuals working at the intersection of electronic music and disaporic traditions. On Bodyguard, 8ULENTINA raises existential quandaries familiar to anyone whose personal boundaries have been violated. \u201cHow do bodies protect each other? How do we deal with that mutual responsibility and trust?\u201d they ask in a text accompanying the album. As on their previous EP, last year\u2019s Eucalyptus, 8ULENTINA refracts percussion and melodies sampled from Turkish and Middle Eastern music through angular club rhythms. They chop and loop excerpts of traditional instrumentation and hand drums alongside kicks and snares at techno BPMs.\nBodyguard\u2019s five tracks are meant to be conversant with each other, with vocal samples formatted as a quasi-poem on the EP\u2019s Bandcamp page. Making sense of these somewhat inscrutable bits of text feels a bit like eavesdropping on a hushed exchange in a corner of the dancefloor. On the opening track,\u00a0a barely audible voice mumbles, \u201cNo, I was fast,\u201d accompanied by an urgent stringed riff based on the makam (a system of scales utilized in Turkish and Middle Eastern music). It would seem to be a response to a question posed in the closer, featuring the Lebanese-Australian producer DJ Plead, punctuated by entrancing woodwind and hand-drum samples: \u201cWere you tough?\u201d Elsewhere, on \u201cNo One Could Get By You,\u201d someone murmurs \u201cI\u2019ve never felt this safe before\u201d in a hushed tone that belies the churning acid drone beneath. It\u2019s a fleeting moment of relief before horror-film violin stabs introduce the next track, \u201cDoesn\u2019t Always Work.\u201d \u201cI spend a lot of time trying not to react to things that other people do,\u201d someone says\u2014de-escalation as a survival tactic.\nPost-#MeToo, the policing of bodies, especially in a nightlife setting, can be complicated. Bouncers decide who enters the club based on appearance, and even when nightclubs establish codes of conduct, it can be unclear how to enforce them. 8ULENTINA is clearly committed to fostering conversations about these issues in their artful manipulation of samples. No solid answers to their questions emerge by the end of Bodyguard\u2019s 15 minutes. But the push-and-pull between prickly and intimate makes for a mesmerizing EP that provokes with every listen.\n", "pptitle": ["bodyguard"]}
