Fitting for an album with a treadmill on the cover, on Le Mal, the bilingual psycho-jazz punk-funk quartet FET.NAT likewise give themselves over to mechanistic processes. They\u2019ve essentially made two records from the same material: Le Mal\u2019s first side features five songs performed by the band, while its back half is dedicated to MIDI reinterpretations\u2014or degradations\u2014of four of them. The structure brings to mind Neu!\u2019s notorious second album, where, having blown their recording budget, the kosmische-rock pioneers padded side two with sped-up and slowed-down versions of songs from an earlier single. But Le Mal\u2019s MIDI manipulations never feel like a ploy to fill the tracklist, nor even companion remixes. Rather, they find this already bizarre band splicing and reformulating their DNA to become even more aggressively strange.\nFET.NAT hail from the small city of Hull, located across the river and the Ontario border from Ottawa, the Canadian capital. Fittingly, they\u2019re a band that straddle musical and cultural divides: Atop the group\u2019s spasmodic rhythms, lead singer and lyricist JFNO delivers his fragmented sing-speak in a hybrid franglais dialect. Hull\u2019s greatest claim to fame, though, is that it\u2019s a party town, a late-night destination for 18-year-old Ottawans eager to take advantage of Quebec\u2019s lower legal drinking age. FET.NAT\u2019s music is hardly the stuff of college-pub playlists, but for all their jarring sonic intrusions and tripped-up time signatures, they know how to entertain. If you can\u2019t exactly dance to their music, you can certainly convulse enthusiastically.\nWhere FET.NAT\u2019s earlier releases were built upon a bedrock of Beefheartian skronk, Le Mal ventures further down the polyrhythmic path of their 2017\u2019s Gaoler EP, cross-wiring the cowbell-clanking, dub-funked faction of \u201980s post-punk (Konk, Pigbag, 23 Skidoo) with the glitchy, skittering cadences of \u201990s IDM. At times, like on the warped and distended \u201cDes Fois,\u201d JNFO\u2019s mutating slow-motion delivery, Pierre-Luc Cl\u00e9ment\u2019s slap-bass spikes, Olivier Fairfield\u2019s stuttering beats, and Linsey Wellman\u2019s saxophone farts all seem to pull the song in different directions. But the resilient rubbery groove of \u201cTapis\u201d is a testament to FET.NAT\u2019s ability to maintain forward momentum even as Wellman\u2019s sax squiggles upset their equilibrium. And on \u201cPatio Monday,\u201d a relentlessly hiccuping rhythm gives way to the simplest of pleasures\u2014a giddy playground chant that conjures the image of schoolchildren playing double dutch on the floor of the Mudd Club.\nOnce FET.NAT start feeding their music through the MIDI filter, any concessions to accessibility swiftly break down. Where \u201cTapis\u201d found JNFO\u2019s suggestively whispered verses hovering unobtrusively below the groove, on \u201cTapis d\u2019Orient,\u201d they\u2019re ominously foregrounded in the mix, while Seinfeld-worthy slap-bass tries to ward off a creeping influx of sci-fi synth oscillations. The greatest disfiguration is reserved for \u201cYour World Is My Mystery Gift,\u201d FET.NAT\u2019s contorted freakazoid of a love song. In its original form, it\u2019s the sort of electro-shocked serenade that might\u2019ve sounded at home on the Knife\u2019s Shaking the Habitual. In its side two sequel, the song becomes a mutant slow jam, melting in a vat of ambient acid and disintegrated chipmunk-soul squeals. If the body is a machine, this one is prone to sudden decelerations and short circuits.\n", "pptitle": ["le", "mal"]}
