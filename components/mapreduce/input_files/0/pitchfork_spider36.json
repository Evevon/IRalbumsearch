He made an acoustic album in a barn; he recorded an instrumental album at the bottom of a canyon, and then another while standing in a river; he toured for years with gigantic spinning gramophone horns; he turned a single song into a seven-track EP by treating it like a film score; he made an actual film score. Along the way, Bird\u2019s image started drifting away from playful fiction-spinner and toward haggard philosopher: sometimes isolating and difficult to follow, always interesting. Around the time that he jolted into a 7/8 breakdown on a sprawling, sorrowful song about physically mutating from tour-life conditions called \u201cAnonanimal,\u201d the Andrew Bird who once promised snacks at the end of civilization was becoming a fading memory.\nThat irreverent, contentedly existential side of Bird makes a pleasantly surprising return on My Finest Work Yet, his most plainly and darkly funny album in a long time. While its cover art depicts Bird swapped into Jacques-Louis David\u2019s \u201cThe Death of Marat,\u201d its music is more Monty Python\u2019s Life of Brian: consumed with human history and equally ready to poke fun at it. It sounds eerily informed by \u201cAlways Look on the Bright Side of Life,\u201d right down to its undermining of doom with whistling: \u201cThe Earth spins faster, whistles right past ya / Whispers death in your ear / Don\u2019t pretend you can\u2019t hear,\u201d Bird casually drops on \u201cManifest,\u201d just before offering another of his signature whistling solos. After a string of releases that sometimes felt like hearing Bird think himself in circles, the philosophy professor drops the chalk mid-proof, turns to the class, and cheerily concludes, \u201cWe\u2019re all screwed!\u201d\nEven those who tend to tune out lyrics can recognize a reinstated directness in Bird\u2019s composing, whether in the ambush of violins on\u201cManifest\u201d, the straighforwardly beautiful ballad \u201cCracking Codes,\u201d or the unrestrained \u201cOH\u201ds that hoist up \u201cOlympians.\u201d There are a few filler moments that would fit on any other Bird album\u2014\u201dFallorun\u201d in particular falls flat\u2014but the rest feel like they share a common attitude of \u201cWhy not?\u201d. \u201cDon the Struggle\u201d actually brings back the 7/8 dance breakdown, but this time to serve as a foil to the song\u2019s \u201cBenny and the Jets\u201d stomp. The flip is as clear as Bird\u2019s shrug when he repeats over and over, \u201cWe\u2019re all just stumbling down / Through an unnamed struggling town.\u201d\nBird knows how to deploy specificity so suddenly and casually that it tickles\u2014and then how to complicate that reaction. Lines here about J. Edgar Hoover, the Spanish Civil War, and Sisyphus all feel more intended to incite chuckling than chin-stroking. On the latter, which is also the name of the opening track and lead single, he questions the condemned Greek king\u2019s dilemma: \u201cDid he raise both fists and say, \u2018To hell with this,\u2019 and just / Let the rock roll?\u201d That image seems more than a little self-referential in light of Bird\u2019s obsessive style of music-making. Here, he takes a moment to set that boulder down, throw his hands up, and grin at the beautiful futility of it all.\n", "pptitle": ["finest", "work"]}
