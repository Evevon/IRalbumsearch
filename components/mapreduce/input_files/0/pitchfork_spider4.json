The focus is vibe and mood, on allowing yourself to\u2014as Hervey sings on \u201cNever Before\u201d\u2014\u201cSip slow with my eyes closed/I can feel more when I let it flow.\u201d\nFree from their major-label deal, Lion Babe returns to the genial blend of R&B, funk, and mellow electronica of their 2016 debut, Begin. To their credit, Lion Babe don\u2019t seem to be chasing hits anymore, and there are moments on this album\u2014like the Pet Shop Boys-sampling, Raekwon-featuring summer jam \u201cWestern World\u201d\u2014that feel truly freed from the constraints of their past work.\nThe album starts off strong with opener \u201cCosmic Wind.\u201d Hervey sinks into a warm, bass-heavy groove, her Badu-indebted vocals imploring her subject to tell what\u2019s on his or her mind. She even slips into a throaty rap, proving herself more than capable; when she deploys her rapping on Cosmic Wind, like on the minimalist \u201cReminisce,\u201d it\u2019s a counterweight to her singing, which sometimes feels on the verge of drifting into sleepy weightlessness.\nThe album is at its best when the pace picks up, effectively canceling out the duo\u2019s desire to set a mood. Standout \u201cInto Me\u201d is a bouncy and effortless electro-bop that finds Hervey operating like a siren: \u201cIntimacy / sexually / emotionally / financially / spiritually / get into me,\u201d she purrs. On the smoldering \u201cSexy Please,\u201d Goodman deploys muted double-time drums that call back to voguing balls, and with a pulse beneath her, Hervey allows herself flashes of cheeky personality that are otherwise missing throughout the album.\nMany of the tracks on Cosmic Wind, however, are undercut by a lack of energy or a distinct identity. They could have been made by a grab bag of alt-R&B artists over the past decade; they meld warbly bass, predictable chord changes, layered vocal effects and nonsensical lyrics to create enjoyable yet inconsequential experiences. In trying to sound laid-back, Lion Babe wind up sounding nearly anonymous.\nSingle \u201cHit the Ceiling\u201d is a prime example. \u201cAll night, gotta stay up / And I just can\u2019t get enough / Going out, I\u2019ll see you around / Downtown in the scene,\u201d Hervey sings. Much of the album follows this tendency, gesturing at an idea rather than filling it in. Hervey\u2019s lyrics desperately need a dose of vulnerability or color; she\u2019s about as convincing on the subject of love as Flava Flav. Goodman, for his part, frequently almost gets there with his production\u2014slow jam \u201cDifferent Planet\u201d features a fat bass line that steer the song toward Timbaland territory but gets stranded in Ginuwine-lite.\nIt\u2019s all passable, but when compared to the charisma and innovation of peers like Nao and VanJess, both of whom released stellar R&B-indebted, genre-bending projects last year, Lion Babe\u2019s attempts to create a vibe that simply isn\u2019t there come off as hollow. Toeing the line between artful restraint and playing it safe can be difficult, and despite the moments where Lion Babe gets it right, they have a long way to go to set the mood they\u2019re so intent on finding.\n", "pptitle": ["cosmic", "wind"]}
