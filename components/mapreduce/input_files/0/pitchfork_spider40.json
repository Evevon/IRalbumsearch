In the years following World War II, eager to circumnavigate the globe with his instrument, the French musician came up with a solution: an inflatable guitar with a balloon for a body and a foldable wooden neck. That humble invention was the origin of what Baschet and his older brother, Bernard, an engineer, would make their life\u2019s work: sonorous objects that blurred the line between sculpture and musical instrument. The otherworldly sounds generated by the Baschet brothers\u2019 sound structures, as they called their devices\u2014like the Cristal Baschet, an array of glass rods played with wet fingers\u2014have inspired musicians from Tom Waits to Jean-Michel Jarre. Now, the instruments form the basis of Make a Wilderness, the first solo album in two years from the ambient musician Jonny Nash.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why Nash would be attracted to the Baschet brothers\u2019 objects, with their rich, resonant timbres, which suggest electronic sounds produced using non-electronic means. Whether solo, in collaboration with Suzanne Kraft, or as a member of Gaussian Curve, Nash tends to pursue the ineffable in his music. An early EP, Phantom Actors, invoked his ambient forebears\u2014Jon Hassell, Mark Isham, Wally Badarou\u2014in tones and textures evocative of tropical sunsets, ripe peaches, a lover\u2019s sigh. His music has only become more diffuse from there, the edges between synthesizer, piano, and standup bass steadily softening, as though worn away by erosion.\nMake a Wilderness is his most ethereal effort yet: a modest set of instrumental sketches that feel cloaked in mystery. The glassy timbres and microtonal harmonies of the Baschet brothers\u2019 objects lend to the desert-mirage air, though it\u2019s impossible to discern how any of these songs were made, or even whether they were composed at all. Their movements are as gently haphazard as the clanking of wind chimes. Studies in stillness, they suggest a winter breeze whistling through a scrapyard, or the creak and murmur of a boat harbor at night.\nThere are no melodies to speak of, though the album\u2019s ephemeral meanderings are not at the expense of more consonant pleasures. A minute and a half into \u201cShell,\u201d a rich, reassuring piano chord rings out, and it is repeated throughout the course of the piece, regular as a beacon in heavy fog. Nash\u2019s minimalist tendencies suggest that he has taken to heart the late Mark Hollis\u2019 advice: \u201cBefore you play two notes, learn how to play one note. And don\u2019t play one note unless you\u2019ve got a reason to play it.\u201d Nash\u2019s touch is distinguished by its patience: He layers his tones with exceptional finesse, taking care not to waste a single sound. Each note feels earned.\nMuch of the album, in fact, draws its inspiration from the quietest, most secretive corners of Hollis\u2019 and his group Talk Talk\u2019s discographies. That\u2019s particularly true of \u201cShell,\u201d with its ruminative piano, and \u201cLanguage Collapsed,\u201d the 10-minute centerpiece of the B-side, where vibraphone paints broad strokes across a blurry backdrop in which flickers of brass and woodwinds flash out from the darkness and disappear just as swiftly. Those ephemeral appearances mark Make a Wilderness\u2019 defining characteristic: Gorgeous while it plays, it\u2019s almost impossible to remember once the needle has hit the run-out groove. But that transience only makes Nash\u2019s mood music that much more alluring. Make a Wilderness makes good on Fran\u00e7ois Baschet\u2019s youthful desire to find a sound that travels well. It\u2019s not just portable; it dissolves into thin air.\n", "pptitle": ["make", "wilder"]}
