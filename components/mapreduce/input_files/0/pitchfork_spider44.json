There\u2019s a never-ending flow of artists springing from Thug\u2019s garden\u2014the most prominent being the drip-enamored pair of Lil Baby and Gunna. Last year, Lil Gotit, alongside his older brother Lil Keed, joined the ranks of rappers inspired by Thug\u2019s quirky delivery. Lil Keed made his stamp instantly, dropping in a guest verse on Thug\u2019s Slime Language, followed by his breakout song, \u201cNameless.\u201d Unlike Keed, Gotit wasn\u2019t off to such a fast start, as the 19-year-old\u2019s instinct for melody wasn\u2019t nearly as developed. But, in a matter of months, Lil Gotit\u2019s verses have become more lively, his delivery more animated, and his songs often feel like a fantasy set in Atlanta\u2019s Lenox Mall. His latest project, Crazy But It\u2019s True, has one purpose: to capitalize on this improvement by finding Lil Gotit a hit song, so he can officially be knighted as one of Atlanta\u2019s next stars.\nFor Lil Gotit, the concept of an album is meaningless. Crazy But It\u2019s True isn\u2019t meant to be a cohesive body of work or made to be consumed in one sitting, it\u2019s 18 darts thrown at the board and hopefully one hits the bullseye. Lil Gotit\u2019s dire search for a hit first began when he dropped a few unenthused Triller videos on Instagram that seemed like an Alamo Records executive was behind the camera holding a match to his contract if he didn\u2019t. Then, he tried to create a viral dance challenge, which of course didn\u2019t work because the dance was overly complex.\nThe gimmicks were unnecessary Crazy But It\u2019s True has more than enough potential to end Gotit\u2019s tireless search for a hit, especially with \u201cDa Real Hoodbabies.\u201d Gotit\u2019s music sounds best when his only cares in the world are letting us know about his love of Percocets and ignoring morals and fashion brands getting canceled to drape himself in a designer that most can\u2019t afford: \u201cGucci ain\u2019t racist, I still rock their clothes.\u201d\nGotit isn\u2019t as much of a crooner as Thug or Lil Keed, his voice is harsher. \u201cNow\u201d is Gotit at his most belligerent, taking a break from the fanciful flexing for lyrics that warn others not to test him in the streets of Atlanta: \u201cI can get the Glock and squeeze it like a lemon, oh/I take his top and twist it red just like its Trippie, huh.\u201d But similar to Lil Baby and Gunna, Gotit\u2019s search for a hit song may end with pairing up with Lil Keed. Next to Keed\u2019s high-pitched delivery, Gotit sounds menacing. And together they are able to successfully replicate the \u201cDrip Too Hard\u201d acoustic guitar formula on their second collaboration on the project, \u201cDrop The Top.\u201d\nThough a handful of the album\u2019s tracks are duds, it\u2019s to be expected when the project bets on them all becoming breakouts. There\u2019s the generic collaboration with Hoodrich Pablo Juan called \u201cOff White\u201d\u2014we get it, Virgil sends you free clothes\u2014that could be mistaken for any Atlanta-based leak that\u2019s surfaced on Spinrilla in the last year. Then there are songs that are bogged down with features like \u201cWe Da Gang\u201d and \u201cOverT\u201d that take away from Lil Gotit\u2019s moment.\nFor some rappers, albums are nothing more than a vehicle to push singles and videos premiered on WorldStarHipHop. Lil Gotit doesn\u2019t care if a portion of his album winds up unessential filler, as long as fans gravitate to a chosen few\u2014songs like \u201cDa Real Hoodbabies\u201d and \u201cNow\u201d are good enough to do that. Crazy But It\u2019s True is Lil Gotit not waiting for fate to take its course, he wants to see if the Atlanta crown fits comfortably on his dome.\n", "pptitle": ["crazi", "true"]}
