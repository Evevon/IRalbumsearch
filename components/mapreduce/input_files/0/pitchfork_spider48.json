Maxo is young enough to dream like a kid, but old enough to be aware he won\u2019t be able to for long. One day, the L.A.-based rapper fantasizes about helping his family living comfortably and wearing a big-ass chain, the next he\u2019s praying for the bare minimum: \u201c23 hope I live to see 24.\u201d As he reflects on the lessons that have helped him grow, he also pauses to feel the pressure of trying to leave his mark before his clock runs out.\nThe creamy vocal samples and muddy drums come from a team of lo-fi rap\u2019s finest\u2014lastnamedavid, Vik, Swarvy, and Roper Williams\u2014and they make every verse seem like it takes place in a dream. Some might compare Maxo\u2019s sound to the baritone Earl Sweatshirt or the abstract MIKE, but he resembles neither. His voice is soothing like watching a wide-open Steph Curry three-pointer on loop, and his lyrics are straightforward, leaving few lines up to interpretation.\nLike anyone in their early 20s, Maxo is often wracked with fear. Few things weigh on him more than the prospect of wasting his remaining days\u2014\u201cMy clock been ticking, I'm just tryna get myself right,\u201d he asserts on \u201cTime.\u201d Even a warm Swarvy instrumental on \u201cStrongside\u201d doesn\u2019t prevent Maxo from shrinking into his shell: \u201cCovers on my head, guess I\u2019m scared of the future,\u201d he confesses.\nBut at his best, Maxo\u2019s dread is balanced with a glimmer of hope, like on the EP standout \u201cIn My Penny\u2019s.\u201d His optimism, when it peeks through, is refreshing for how hard-earned it feels: \u201cEven last place see the finish line,\u201d he tells himself. On \u201cCrown Heights\u201d Maxo stares his depression in its face, accepting that he will live with it while balancing acceptance with positivity (\u201cBut I\u2019m just countin\u2019 my blessing, all that I have for you\u201d).\nThrough LIL BIG MAN\u2019s brief runtime, Maxo never finds the answer he\u2019s looking for, but his search is winning on its own. Within 30 minutes, he hits upon a tangle of vivid feelings\u2014uncertainty, anxiety, hope, depression, pain, love. \u201cMaybe I be thinking too much, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he shrugs on \u201cCrown Heights.\u201d Above all, LIL BIG MAN captures this sensation: Nothing defines being 23 like knowing that you don\u2019t know shit.\n", "pptitle": ["lil", "big", "man"]}
