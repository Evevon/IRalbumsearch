The young wordsmith, also known as Santan Dave, would stare into the camera and relay fierce reflections about his tumultuous life, using them as a lyrical crowbar to pry open the doors keeping voiceless Londoners in the dark. On \u201cThiago Silva\u201d he proved he could hold his own at a grime tempo, and fans soon discovered he played the piano, too. It was difficult to fathom that he was only a teenager. Now Dave is 20, and his debut album, Psychodrama, is one of the most significant bodies of British rap music in a generation.\nPsychodrama is a form of psychotherapy in which patients role-play events from their past to heal and make sense of themselves. Dave uses the term as a cathartic glue to bind heavy themes together, bringing listeners into his therapy room while he grapples with societal injustice, industry contradictions, and private pain. The album starts and finishes with songs \u201cPsycho\u201d and \u201cDrama,\u201d respectively, and the latter includes a touching dialogue with his older brother, who is serving a life sentence in prison. This haunting backdrop has long bled into Dave\u2019s lyricism\u2014\u201cNever had a father and I needed you to be the figure,\u201d he cries in the album\u2019s closing passage\u2014but its impact is more closely examined across Psychodrama than ever before. Over 11 songs and much hypnotic piano playing, Dave sets his conceptual limits, and then fills them with an urban opera that blends his desire to exorcize demons with old-soul musical wisdom and youthful performativity.\nWhen the single \u201cBlack\u201d was debuted on BBC Radio 1 as Annie Mac\u2019s Hottest Record in the World, it garnered backlash from listeners who missed its nuanced critique of language as a limiting construct on racial identity, expression, and diversity. But the song\u2014on which Dave shares his piano bench with acclaimed producer Fraser T. Smith, whose influence can be heard throughout the album\u2014is not just a proud race anthem. As political and media establishments in Britain continue to fall short in representing ethnic minority experiences (in one recent case, a centrist politician found herself unable to avoid even a basic faux pas), \u201cBlack\u201d doubles as a manifesto for responsible phraseology, and against anachronistic stereotyping. \u201cA kid dies, the blacker the killer, the sweeter the news/And if he\u2019s white, you give him a chance, he\u2019s ill and confused/If he\u2019s black he\u2019s probably armed, you see him and shoot,\u201d Dave assesses.\nSongs like \u201cScrewface Capital\u201d and \u201cStreatham\u201d stick closely to Dave\u2019s formula of conscious, modern UK rap, delivering hard yet emotionally available odes to the cold city that birthed him. These are highlights for purists seeking thumping beats to match Dave\u2019s anger, and each verse is laced with its own string of intricate wordplay and admissions\u2014sometimes cheeky, often sullen. \u201cTell me what you know about a bag full of bills/And your mom crying out, saying, \u2018Son, I can\u2019t take it,\u2019/And then staring in the mirror for an hour/With a tear in your eye like, \u2018I gotta go make it,\u2019\u201d he spits. Softer, poppier offerings like \u201cPurple Heart\u201d and \u201cVoices\u201d will appeal to Dave\u2019s increasingly diverse audience of older fans and newcomers seeking easy access to London\u2019s unforgivingly hardline rap scene. What\u2019s more, by teaming up with afrobeat star Burna Boy and celebrated British-Ghanaian hitmaker Jae5 for \u201cLocation,\u201d and fellow London boundary-pusher J Hus on \u201cDisaster,\u201d Dave stretches the album\u2019s reach to absorb upbeat diasporic influence, movement, and color.\nBut the gravitational pull at the center of this magnum opus is \u201cLesley,\u201d an 11-minute deep dive into the life and abusive relationship of a woman Dave meets on a train, as if colliding \u201ctwo different worlds in the same location.\u201d It is a microcosm of Psychodrama\u2019s refusal to contain itself as a work of art, instead reaching for emotional intimacy and therapeutic resonance. By its end, \u201cLesley\u201d becomes a passionate call-to-action; as Dave puts it, \u201ca message to a woman with a toxic man\u201d who he is \u201cbegging\u2026 to get support if you\u2019re lost or trapped.\u201d In a world craving artists who use their influence for good, Dave offers a road map for inspired musicians and inquisitive listeners alike.\n\u201cLesley\u201d closes on the disembodied voice of Dave\u2019s fictional therapist, who expresses relief as his client nears the end of the album\u2019s psychodramatic course. \u201cI\u2019m just happy you\u2019re at a place now where you feel you understand your emotions, and are in control,\u201d he says. A different kind of hero\u2019s journey through the musical mind, Psychodrama feels less like a platform for clout than a starting point for self-help and paradigmatic change.\n", "pptitle": ["psychodrama"]}
