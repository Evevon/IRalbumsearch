It was an obvious joke that worked on two levels. There was the implicit contradiction in terms, which seemed more preposterous in a dial-up world where the internet had yet to dissolve geographic and musical boundaries; the gag was also rooted in the equally absurd notion that Stephen Malkmus would deign to make music that sounded like anyone other than himself. As the primary singer and guitarist in Pavement, Malkmus had not only been one of the defining figures of 1990s indie rock; his signature mix of skewed, fuzz-coated songcraft and cryptic lyricism had practically become a subgenre unto itself. And with his post-Pavement outfit the Jicks, the song has more or less remained the same, even as the guitar solos have gotten longer.\nNow in his 30th year as a recording artist, Stephen Malkmus is so good at being Stephen Malkmus that the mere prospect of him futzing around and making electronic music with Ableton Live might raise eyebrows, even after plenty of indie-rock titans of his vintage have dabbled in digitalism. Malkmus started writing Groove Denied while he was living in Berlin in the early 2010s, after a DJ friend chaperoned him into the city\u2019s infamous club scene\u2014but Ravement this is not. Rather than thrust him into foreign musical territory, the album returns Malkmus to the murky soup of lo-fi, DIY post-punk that once served as Pavement\u2019s petri dish. But now he\u2019s taking his cues from the primitive, proto-industrial synthwave of the Normal and \u201cBeing Boiled\u201d-era Human League instead of the gnarled guitars of Swell Maps and the Fall. As far as records inspired by Berlin nightclub benders go, the vibe here is less \u201cDance like no one\u2019s watching\u201d than \u201cMess around like no one\u2019s listening.\u201d\nGroove Denied channels circa-1979 post-punk not just in austere sound but in mindset, harking back to an era when machines represented the sound of the future but no one was quite sure of what do with them yet. There\u2019s a palpable sense of \u201cWhat does this button do?\u201d curiosity to the opening \u201cBelziger Faceplant,\u201d where jabbing synth notes arrhythmically spar with a sputtering drum-machine beat while Malkmus intrudes with an atonal croon like someone hamming it up in a karaoke booth. Even as he fortifies the rhythm with tambourine effects and a circular police-siren refrain, he pokes and prods it with distorted synth bleats, as if checking to see if his steak is done.\nGroove Denied is technically Malkmus\u2019 second proper solo album after his 2001 debut, but that record was really a trial run for the then-unbilled Jicks. In stark contrast to the Jicks\u2019 West Coast open-road splendor, Groove Denied is a true solitary effort, the sound of after-hours home-studio tinkering, gear bursting with tangled wires, and cabin-fever claustrophobia. This is especially true of \u201cForget Your Place,\u201d a slow-motion swirl of ambient techno where Malkmus modulates his voice down into a drowsy drone, imagining a future where the robots have come for his job. Even his overtures toward straightforward synth pop eventually start to short-circuit. For a recent Noisey feature, Malkmus sat down and listened to LCD Soundsystem\u2019s first album for the first time; fittingly, \u201cViktor Borgia\u201d\u2014with its neon-lit Kraftwerkian tone clusters, minimalist disco groove, and archly delivered meta-lyrics about making a beat connection (\u201cWe walk into the club/Thank the heavens above\u201d)\u2014sounds like Malkmus trying to make a James Murphy song having only read about the dance-punk icon. But he stops short of building the track up into a LCD-level thumper, because he\u2019s having too much fun switching up the drum-machine settings.\nCompared to the triumph of 2018\u2019s Jicks effort Sparkle Hard\u2014an album that featured some of the most endearing and incisive writing of Malkmus\u2019 career\u2014Groove Denied can\u2019t help but feel like a minor effort. It\u2019s essentially his answer to McCartney II\u2014the sound of a veteran artist with two beloved bands under his belt reveling in the freedom to indulge a latent fascination with the latest gadgets. Like that record, Groove Denied\u2019s tech fetishism ultimately has its limits. A handful of these tracks (like the toga-party Velvets rumble of \u201cRushing the Acid Frat\u201d) are guitar-based one-man-band rockers that could\u2019ve easily been retooled into Jicks jams. But Groove Denied\u2019s slapdash kitchen-sink experimentation rarely overwhelms Malkmus\u2019 singular charms. With the lonesome, sitar-speckled lament \u201cCome Get Me\u201d and the Southern Gothic prog-pop opus \u201cOcean of Revenge\u201d (whose earworm chorus melody was teased in the string arrangement of Sparkle Hard\u2019s \u201cBrethren\u201d), the album yields a pair of aces that can stand alongside his finest songs. Since the \u201990s, Malkmus and Pavement have become lazy shorthand for \u201cironic slackers,\u201d a reputation that\u2019s always undersold the emotional distress and subtle social commentary at the heart of his best writing. But even on a willfully irreverent record that puts a premium on groove, those qualities can\u2019t be denied.\n", "pptitle": ["groov", "deni"]}
