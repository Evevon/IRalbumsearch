It\u2019s the perfect tune to \u201click back\u201d\u2014to pull back and rewind to the start\u2014as is the practice of the mobile discotheque soundsystems on the island, building the anticipation for the beat to drop.\nKoffee, who initially drew attention with an acoustic tribute to Usain Bolt, has a crisp delivery that moves back and forth between rapid-fire ragga grit and one drop conscious reggae, a style referred to as the portmanteau \u201csingjay\u201d (combining \u201csinger\u201d and \u201cdeejay,\u201d the Jamaican term for MC). There\u2019s been a great deal of talk about up-and-coming women in Jamaican music\u2014Shenseea and HoodCelebrityy, to name only a couple\u2014but this five-song EP indicates that Koffee can, like many of the singjays who made their mark in the late 1990s and early 2000s (Sizzla, Capleton, Buju Banton), navigate between dancehall and reggae with ease.\nProduction on the EP reflects multiple genres and seems to travel in and out of Jamaica as well. \u201cToast\u201d might be called near-Naija in its styling\u2014and no surprise, given that Walshy Fire was involved. As a member of Major Lazer, the outfit known for its constant (and sometimes controversial) international search for rhythms, Walshy is no stranger to Afrobeats, that genre with a woefully vague name. And then there\u2019s the much more reggaefied \u201cThrone\u201d: It oscillates between plaintive chorus and sharp verse, showing off Koffee\u2019s ability to shift from \u201calto to baritone,\u201d as she sings. The thump of \u201cBlazin\u201d provides adequate backing for Koffee\u2019s rapid-fire delivery; fellow newcomer Jane McGizmo\u2019s soprano chorus floats and echoes above.\nGiven that this is a woman whose initial career goal was to be a pharmacist, it\u2019s hard not to think about her as mixing up some seriously original medicine, because some of these tunes just tower over a whole lot of what\u2019s being released these days. A one-minute performance of \u201cRapture\u201d on a bespoke riddim by the UK\u2019s Toddla T led to a breathless Twitter reaction. The longer version here is a touch moodier, but the boastful chorus, \u201cKoffee come in like a rapture, and everybody get capture,\u201d is sticky, sticky, sticky. What is clearly constant throughout each of the strong five songs here is a focus on hooks\u2014it\u2019s another thing that sets her apart.\nMaybe she gets it from Chronixx. The breakout reggae-revival superstar has a penchant for perfect hooks that has rubbed off on this young woman; she\u2019s obviously been paying attention to how important memorability is where melodies are concerned. It\u2019s hard to come away from listening to a song like \u201cRaggamuffin\u201d and not be humming the chorus. When she performed it live at the legendary Tuff Gong studios as part of BBC Radio 1xtra\u2019s 2018 visit to the island, Chronixx added bits and pieces to the chorus. Watching the video, there are a couple moments where the Grammy nominee breaks out in a huge smile as Koffee casually spits lyrics over the classic real rock riddim. He knows that he\u2019s hearing something special. The Rapture EP is further proof of her talents, and its mix of rhythms and reggae seem likely to be but the first taste of what\u2019s yet to come.\n", "pptitle": ["raptur", "ep"]}
