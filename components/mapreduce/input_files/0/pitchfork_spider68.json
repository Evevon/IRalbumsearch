Instead, PTP's mission seems to be to annihilate genre boundaries and revel in the brilliant debris\u2014like releasing a musing on the REM sleep cycle that flashes between moments of serene sci-fi ambience and pummeling video game techno (Nima Aghiani's REMS), presenting a noise-rock workout to invoke trance-like feelings of healing (Among The Rocks And Roots' Raga), or running tapestries of percussion and field recordings from Tehran through an echo-chamber as commentary on chemical attacks in Iraq (Saint Abdullah\u2019s Stars Have Eyes).\nDis Fig's PURGE fits snugly into the PTP credo: The record wavers between Chen\u2019s scorched vocals battling to be heard over brutal, electronic production and luminous, minimalist moments where her words resonate as tender pleas. Along the way, the album nods to trip-hop, techno, noise, punk and soul influences. But despite its progressive production, its emotional heart challenges the listener to empathize why Chen whips between violent outbursts and quiet pockets of respite.\nThe album opens with \"Drum Fife Bugle,\u201d where glitchy electronic jabs are paired with what sounds like a fanfare of panpipes, before being joined by sampled panting and buzzsaw motor-blades. The track has a frantic quality, conjuring images of Chen escaping through wild overgrowth, phosphorescent alien lands, or an emotional battlefield. It\u2019s followed by \"Alive,\" where Chen sounds caged: Her distressed vocals\u2014\u201cI came to see if you're alive\u201d\u2014are suppressed by waves of murmuring bass and digital volcanic ash sputtering around. After the intensity of \u201cAlive\u201d comes the revitalizing \u201cWatering,\u201d a ghostly quiet storm of a song consisting of lapping waves of digital noise. This vertiginous setup continues, with the maelstrom of vocals and electronic production typifying songs like \u201cU Said U Were\u201d and \u201cUnleash\u201d soothed by the hymnal solitude of \u201cThe Hermit\u201d and the confessional digi-soul of \u201cWHY.\u201d\nThe ebb and flow between drama and reflection define PURGE\u2019s topography. Her words are often repressed by the production, but she isn\u2019t crying out in vain\u2014she\u2019s feeling for tears in a fabric of her own creation. This comes to a head between \u201cPurge\u201d and \u201cWHY\u201d via a 30-second interlude where she\u2019s heard listening to a tinny Cantopop song while puttering around her home. There\u2019s something shocking in the domesticity of it all and it unlocks PURGE. As PURGE ends with the relative instrumental calm of \u201cI Am the Tree,\u201d you realize all of Chen\u2019s self-induced emotional pain and unstinting soul-searching has been a mechanism to just, simply, feel secure.\n", "pptitle": ["purg"]}
