Over the past decade, La Dispute\u2019s peers in the New Wave of Post-Hardcore (or just \u201cThe Wave\u201d) have increasingly leaned into their underlying populist aspects\u2014Touche Amore emerged as populist firebrands, the early screamo of Pianos Become the Teeth has burnished into silvery mope-rock, mewithoutYou\u2019s folky mysticism has veered uncannily close to R.E.M.\u2014but from the beginning, the Grand Rapids quintet have been the most demanding and divisive band in a fanatical subgenre. Their faithful read the Grand Rapids post-hardcore band\u2019s music as prophetic, dazzling, beyond mere songcraft\u2014to be treated like literature rather than music.\nPanorama comes five years after La Dispute\u2019s most recent record. Having already fulfilled one New Wave rite of passage (being produced by Will Yip), they complete another by signing to Epitaph. But while Panorama is their most user-friendly release, it\u2019s the one that asks most of all to be engaged with like a book\u2014with undivided attention and without any expectation of immediate gratification, to linger on and to be footnoted for later discussion and rumination.\nLike their peers, La Dispute have determinedly whittled away at their extremities. Their 2008 debut Somewhere At the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair remains one of the most unique hardcore albums of the century\u2014Jordan Dreyer mumbled, hectored and caterwauled anachronistic lyrics informed by Annabel Lee, Joanna Newsom, Kurt Vonnegut, and Japanese folklore, while the band dabbled in jazz, screamo, prog-rock and spoken word. Both wildly pretentious and guileless, it\u2019s a rare document of a band with no expectations, no precedents, and unchecked ambition. Dreyer has expressed guilt over how the bombast of early fan favorites could obscure and distort their intentions; listeners could gloss over the thoughtful survey of race and retribution in his fictionalized eyewitness account of a failed drive-by shooting 2011\u2019s \u201cKing Park\u201d and just zone out during the big crescendo. Their approach on 2014\u2019s Rooms of the House was more muted, but even a fabricated breakup album still has fairly traditional moments of emotional release.\nPanorama skillfully and subtly creeps towards resonance rather than catharsis, an approach that can make even their own colleagues sound like they\u2019re trying to cheat towards the big release. Even when La Dispute rock, they do so like they\u2019re trying to tiptoe on a frozen pond. \u201cAnxiety Panorama\u201d and \u201cView From Our Bedroom Window\u201d are too plaintive to whip up a circle pit. The guitars are nearly silent throughout the frostbitten \u201cIn Northern Michigan,\u201d until they seep through the silence like car exhaust in a closed garage. The chorus of \u201cFootsteps at the Pond\u201d finds Dreyer\u2019s vocals drowning in guitar midrange, one of the many times where his lyrics become obscured or buried in the mix\u2014a curious decision for a band who relies so heavily on Dreyer\u2019s words, but a rewarding one, evoking half-remembered car conversations, murmured dream states, panicked awakenings.\nPanorama finds Dreyer ruminating on the relatively tragedy-free 31 years of his life and asking how he can provide support to someone who\u2019s experienced far worse. \u201cCould I even be half of what you need?\u201d he begs on \u201cFulton Street I.\u201d Without guidance, Dreyer moves forward with good intentions and a crippling fear of making matters worse. \u201cWe keep her picture on the fridge/I keep a rabbit toy for kids/You gave me strength to fix myself/I gave you tokens, toys and gifts,\u201d Dreyer offers on \u201cRhodonite and Grief.\u201d  With its slinky, diminished jazz chords and mournful horns, it\u2019s a possible sequel to Rooms of the House\u2019s \u201cWoman (in mirror)\u201d\u2014it\u2019s an album about death and grief, but also about the inability to communicate.\n\u201cYou said \u2018kill me by surprise\u2019 again/\u2018I don\u2019t want to stay alive\u2019/To watch the words go first like hers,\u201d Dreyer moans, writing from the perspective of his real-life partner. \u201cIf we could choose the way we leave/Fill out circles on a ballot sheet/Vote the way we\u2019ll go...What would we do?,\u201d Dreyer asks on the lengthy, awe-inspiring closer \u201cYou Ascendant,\u201d cycling through heavenly and humdrum ways to die before realizing the crushing truth that someone\u2019s going to have to go first.  Perhaps the only solution to avoiding this grief is passing together, or at least, living in the possibility that it might not have to end at all. \u201cOr can we live forever here? Be buried in our best memories,\u201d he asks, thinking over drunken good times, an intimate road trip, everything that makes \u201clife too beautiful, too sweet, despite everything.\u201d In the end, Panorama is a love story\u2014you just need to read between the lines.\n", "pptitle": ["panorama"]}
