Her coos echo on \u201cMirror Me,\u201d a song comprising only her voice and a reverb effect, cascading in foggy layers. Elsewhere, her voice grows restless. It shudders like tectonic plates colliding  in the first moments of \u201cEver,\u201d stutters as she recites strings of ones and zeroes on \u201cBinary.\u201d In her work, the voice is not a solitary character bracing against its environment. It is the environment.\nDescended from survivors of the Armenian genocide, the Syrian American producer and vocalist weaves the legacy of generational trauma into music that carries a futuristic sheen. The album's earliest songs were written in 2011 while K \u00c1 R Y Y N was mourning two family members who died in Aleppo.  She sings from a place rooted in the past, but always seems to be accelerating into the future: \u201cAmbets Gorav,\u201d is a solemn rendition of an Armenian folk song against a low electronic drone that funnels her voice into pixelating machines. The effect is dizzying, as if K \u00c1 R Y Y N were asking her listeners to gaze into vanishing points at opposite horizons.\nMany of the songs on The Quanta Series were released in previous years as singles. Sequenced into an LP, they carry more dramatic weight. K \u00c1 R Y Y N's CV includes score work for games and films, and she composed music for the experimental opera Of Light while studying under performance artist Marina Abramovi\u0107\u2014she\u2019s well-versed in the intricacies of narrative and the productive confusion that can arise when a story starts to blur. In college, she was also a student of the pioneering experimental electronic musician Pauline Oliveros, whose chaotic influence shivers across The Quanta Series.\nK \u00c1 R Y Y N begins stories and then unstitches them, sending her words tumbling across icy electronic production. She's fond of puns and double meanings in her lyrics, swirling together \u201cI\u201d and \u201ceye,\u201d playing on the polyvalence of the word \u201ctongue\u201d: the body part and the language it produces. \u201cTongue is the word I want to have with you,\u201d she sings on \u201cBinary,\u201d making a simultaneous bid for communication and sensuality. Often, her semantics break down in favor of pure sound. On \u201cAleppo,\u201d she leaps up into her head voice, punctuating her lines with wobbling electronic bass. \u201cI console your memory protect,\u201d she sings, \u201cI console your/Recall.\u201d Her enjambment is strange, her language impressionistic. The words are vessels for her voice and not the other way around.\nIn the holes she leaves open throughout the album's production, the rests and pauses and empty spaces, K \u00c1 R Y Y N hints at a history of ruin. \u201cToday is the saddest day for me,\u201d she sings on \u201cToday I Read Your Life Story 11:11.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m missing you all the time/I have the stories you wrote one time.\u201d She barely sings above a whisper and corrodes her voice with an effect that makes it sound as though she is crying out across a faulty phone line.\nAmid the loss she mourns, the late family members and the lacunae in their histories, K \u00c1 R Y Y N locates a passage forward. She is still alive to carry her family's story. \u201cSegmen & the Line,\u201d a melodic continuation of \u201cLife Story,\u201d concludes the album on a placid note of resolution. \u201cYou are the segment/I am the line,\u201d she sings. \u201cNow that you're gone/I can breathe again.\u201d Death hangs heavy over the record, but in its shadow, K \u00c1 R Y Y N projects herself into the future. An upbeat percussive glitch spurs on \u201cSegment &amp; the Line,\u201d shoving her forward even as funereal drones tether her to the past. She does not close the record by allowing its grief and horror to dissipate. She lets them linger but quickens her pace, proving herself capable of carrying their weight.\n", "pptitle": ["quanta", "seri"]}
