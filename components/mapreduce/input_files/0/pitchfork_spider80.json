sample of pop music in 2018, something to throw in a time capsule so that future explorers scouring Earth\u2019s climate-wrecked mess would know exactly how good the radio was on average, you can\u2019t do better than Zedd and Maren Morris\u2019 \u201cThe Middle.\u201d The hit is a slightly snazzier version of Zedd\u2019s previous hit, Alessia Cara collaboration \u201cStay,\u201d with the same vocoder chorus and clock ticks. For Morris\u2019 part, the writers also auditioned Anne-Marie (the former front-runner, who lost it because of the music jobbing equivalent of a non-compete agreement), two members of Fifth Harmony, Carly Rae Jepsen(!), and more than 12 other singers.\nThis is how plenty of songs are made and Zedd\u2019s career has consisted of making these inoffensive tracks over which singers can belt and yearn and seize the stage; Morris is great at all three. But as the litany of not-quite-A-listers considered suggests, it\u2019s more a conduit for royalties than for star-making: not an A Star Is Born, more a star borne ceaselessly into the pop machine.\nAnd by doing \u201cThe Middle\u201d at all, Maren Morris became a flashpoint whether she liked it or not (spoiler: not) for the perpetually nasty debate over country music becoming \u201ctoo pop,\u201d and what that even means. Last year, she tweeted in her defense after a semi-influential blogger accused her of \u201c[conducting] herself like she is an absolute superstar and hot shit,\u201d on grounds of existing. Girl is full of this reluctant defensiveness, which shouldn\u2019t have to exist but does, both on record and in its promotion. \u201cI\u2019m not setting out to make an EDM album or a big, you know, pop-diva record,\u201d Morris told The Ringer. \u201cI just wanna make a record that sounds like the inside of my head.\u201d\nJudging by Girl, the inside of Morris\u2019 head sounds like a Hobby Lobby. An EDM album it is not. A pop-diva record it could be, if the diva is LeAnn Rimes or Faith Hill. It is also not Morris\u2019 dreaded full-Ariana Grande turn. Songwriters Greg Kurstin (Kelly Clarkson, Pink) and Sarah Aarons (Camila Cabello, Khalid)\u2014already well-toward the acoustic side of songwriting teams\u2014only contribute two songs, \u201cGirl\u201d and Brandi Carlile duet \u201cCommon.\u201d The rest are written by mostly Nashville songwriters. But it isn\u2019t really a country-country record either; remove the unmistakably twangy verse by the Brothers Osborne, and there\u2019d be no strong tells.\nThis is less a sign of Morris\u2019 poppiness than just where the music industry is now. Mainstream pop is increasingly welcoming country artists, no doubt noticing the success of one Taylor Swift and, even more, the fact that country radio is now more popular overall than \u201ccontemporary hits\u201d/Top 40. Whether this is a sign of boom times or just a sign that the kids have fled to streaming, it\u2019s resulting in stuff like Florida Georgia Line and Bebe Rexha\u2019s \u201cMeant to Be\u201d or the Chainsmokers\u2019 recent single with Kelsea Ballerini, \u201cThis Feeling.\u201d Meanwhile, country today increasingly just sounds like \u201990s pop-rock: like \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Miss a Thing\u201d or \u201cSemi-Charmed Life.\u201d\nCountry music tends to process this in their music: as Rob Harvilla wrote in The Ringer, \u201ca fun and casual and not-at-all contrived thing country music stars love to do is name-drop pop stars in their songs,\u201d in order to lyrically crash its party. Morris did it in breakout hit \u201cMy Church,\u201d and does it on Girl too. On the title track, she does it implicitly, turning country\u2019s \u201chalo\u201d trope\u2014recently done growlingly by Chris Stapleton and hilariously by Keith Urban\u2014into a Beyonc\u00e9 interpolation. In \u201cA Song for Everything,\u201d she\u2019s more explicit: \u201cWhat\u2019s your time machine? Springsteen or \u2018Teenage Dream\u2019?\u201d she sings, alongside a five-note piano bit that makes it sound like a jingle for the very concept of music. She reminisces about when \u201cColdplay still played clubs,\u201d like \u201cLosing My Edge\u201d by someone with the edge of a pillow. By lavishing so much time on the identity of her faves, Morris barely has any left for her own.\nToo much of Girl is like this. Where Taylor Swift crossed over by writing deeply personal songs, like heart-emoji texts sent to millions of girls directly, and Kacey Musgraves crossed over with a warm, earnest and doggedly untrendy record, Girl crosses over by demonstrating Maren Morris is a powerhouse talent who can sing the hell out of every middle-of-the-road style going. One of Morris\u2019 best traits is her goofy streak, as heard on singles like \u201cRich\u201d (\u201cIf I had a dime every time that you crossed my mind/Well, I\u2019d basically be sitting on a big-ass pile of dimes.\u201d) Girl is best when it can peek out, as on the guitar chug swaggering stomp of lead single \u201cGirl,\u201d or \u201cThe Feels\u201d: effervescent bubbly pop-country at its best, words spilling out at the speed of feelings. \u201cRSVP\u201d is the closest the album comes to R&B, particularly in Morris\u2019 vocals, and done coyly, with whirring percussion. \u201cGreat Ones\u201d slams into its Southern-rock chorus too inevitably, but the verses do suggest a twitchy novelty that could have been.\nBut too much of Girl is stifling repertoire: suggesting all genres at once, excelling at none. \u201cMake Out With Me\u201d is undeniably tender, but it\u2019s also basically a Meghan Trainor song, from its retro-repro stylings\u2014the song begins with a faux-crackly \u201cthis is the end of side one of this record\u201d\u2014and doo-wop lilt to the bowdlerization of a song clearly about a booty call but lyrically stuck at first base. Taken as a whole, it\u2019s hard to imagine the audience who enjoys every corner of this album. It\u2019s even harder to imagine the artist Morris really wants to be.\n", "pptitle": ["girl"]}
