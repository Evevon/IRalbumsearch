In the U.S., the Perth-based songwriter\u2019s debut was \u201cBoys Will Be Boys,\u201d a commanding song about rape culture that landed in the fall of 2017, just as #MeToo crescendoed. In that moment, Donnelly\u2019s indictment of victim-blamers echoed the sentiment of the thousands of women called upon to publicly excavate their trauma. The single introduced then 25-year-old Donnelly\u2014who already had a following and an EP (Thrush Metal, reissued in the U.S. last year) back at home\u2014as an artist with a captivating voice and a powerful message.\n\u201cBoys Will Be Boys\u201d feels as vital and affecting today as when it first came out, but it divulges just a fraction of what makes Donnelly\u2019s songwriting so special. On Beware of the Dogs, her first full-length, a more robust picture emerges. Her songs are complex and surprising, full of sharp corners poised to bruise unsuspecting limbs. Trading in humor as well as gravitas, they are often pulled taut with genuine pain and then snapped with a well-placed punch line. Opener \u201cOld Man,\u201d where Donnelly inveighs against abusers, sets the tone for the record. Its weighty subject matter grates against the chipper guitar tone and Donnelly\u2019s breezy delivery of the song\u2019s most vivid line: \u201cYour personality traits don\u2019t count if you put your dick in someone\u2019s face.\u201d Is she going for a laugh, or a cringe, or both? It sounds like a crass joke, even as it lays out a grim reality.\nThis sort of irony is the crux of Donnelly\u2019s songwriting. It inserts a consistent point of view across an album whose songs range considerably in scope, at times contracting around the singer\u2019s idle thoughts, at others expanding to bigger sociopolitical topics. Donnelly loves the element of surprise so much she\u2019s built it right into the track list, writing songs that demolish the expectations set by their titles\u2014like \u201cDie,\u201d an upbeat take on a crumbling relationship that likens a partner\u2019s inconsistency to errant driving, and ends with Donnelly gleefully chanting, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna die!\u201d You can picture her drop-and-rolling, Lady Bird-style, from the passenger seat. \u201cWatching Telly,\u201d on the other hand, isn\u2019t at all about the titular activity; it\u2019s a jittery synth number addressing men who rob women of corporeal agency (\u201cThey tape dollar signs to our bodies/And tell us not to show our skin\u201d).\nThe way Donnelly wields her humor can be uplifting, empowering listeners to find the levity in tough situations. It can also be deeply unnerving. Devoid of context, the line \u201cLike a mower in the morning/I will never let you rest\u201d\u2014a legitimate threat couched in language befitting suburban dads\u2014is a hoot. When I first heard Donnelly sing it on \u201cBoys Will Be Boys,\u201d I giggled, then squirmed in my seat, furious at myself for having laughed aloud at a song about rape. Then again, that may just be the point\u2014discomfort is perhaps the most appropriate sensation to experience while listening to this song.\nIn some ways, Beware of the Dogs feels like a relative of recent work by Donnelly\u2019s countrywoman Courtney Barnett. Both writers wander between the mundane and the momentous; they showcase their wit and punkish attitudes in songs known to turn on a dime. Donnelly has one tool in her kit which Barnett lacks\u2014an impressively dexterous voice, which she puts to work in service of some of her album\u2019s most winsome moments. She can coax out a lovely vibrato, as on \u201cAllergies,\u201d a forlorn breakup tune that unfolds over delicate solo guitar; she can yelp and tease like she does on \u201cTricks,\u201d a cheerful caricature of moronic Australian men. Donnelly got her start in cover bands, singing AC/DC and Aretha to drunk pharmaceutical reps (whose lewd behavior, incidentally, inspired \u201cTricks\u201d) at conventions, which explains her versatility and range. That\u2019s not to say that Donnelly\u2019s an imitator\u2014what she accomplishes with these 13 tracks is distinctive.\nFierce as Donnelly\u2019s writing can be, it\u2019s empathetic to the core. Her concern for vulnerable bodies surfaces repeatedly; she sings for friends who have suffered abuse, for women who feel the pinch of objectification, and, on the album\u2019s title track, for her country\u2019s First Nations population and the injustices they have endured. These songs don\u2019t contain much promise of resolution\u2014how could they, really\u2014but they offer solidarity and, in their humor, grace, and rampant unpredictability, are perfectly human. \u201cI like the way that you tell all your tales,\u201d Donnelly sings to her companion on one track; \u201cWould it kill you to listen for once?\u201d With Beware of the Dogs, she shows off a singular talent in both arenas.\n", "pptitle": ["bewar", "dog"]}
