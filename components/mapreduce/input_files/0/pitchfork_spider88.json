Free-flowing like her Pisces sign, the artist\u2019s winding career is proof of her ability to make waves in various spaces. Before arriving with her new project, the singer-songwriter was known mostly as a gifted background vocalist and featured guest with acts like Gorillaz, Brasstracks, and SBTRKT on his 2011 song, \u201cPharaohs.\u201d In 2012, she took a leap and premiered \u201cStars,\u201d her first independent and dub-heavy track. Over the last six years, Gabor has been working hard on building her otherworldly sound. On her debut album Fantasy & Facts, Gabor has re-emerged with silvery melodies that expand on the electronic rhythms she holds close.\nSonically, the project lives within the special ecosystem of experimental R&B while Gabor\u2019s emotional candor carries its own light. In 2018, she shared it on her first album single, \u201cIllusions,\u201d  featuring Sampha, which is a heart-rushing song where the two singers yearn the ghosts of a past love. Throughout all 11 tracks on Fantasy & Facts, Gabor\u2019s production is thrilling, but she doesn\u2019t let it overshadow what\u2019s on her mind and heart.\nHer sincerity isn\u2019t heavy, it\u2019s refreshing. On the standout single, \u201cI Could Be Yours,\u201d produced by the Stereotypes (who also worked on Bruno Mars\u2019 \u201c24K Magic\u201d), Gabor tells a lover that pride and regret is the only thing stopping them from being with her again. \u201cTomorrow might not come for us/But you still wait for fate/You know how I was the one/But things didn\u2019t go your way,\u201d she sings. It seems like the type of heartfelt honesty that can only be shared and treasured far away from a jaded world. Gabor\u2019s saccharine harmonies magnify the urgency of her bold and starry-eyed feelings. She sinks into a deeper groove on \u201cF*ck up the Bass,\u201d which is a slow and sensual cut with galactic chords. Gabor doesn\u2019t want to be limited to any specific sound, but the song\u2019s soulfulness leaves a yearning for more sultry tracks like this.\nGabor walks the lines of many genres but categorizes her music simply as \u201cfeels.\u201d The description is vague, but it\u2019s more fitting than the industry classifications that are a tad too linear for her art. On Fantasy & Facts, she flows through 42-minutes of moods, stretching her smoky tone comparable to Kelis\u2019 which brings fullness to her sadness and adoration. The end of Fantasy & Facts seems to lose a bit of momentum. The latter tracks are all solid and of high-quality, but it\u2019s hard to top the hypnotizing mid-album gem \u201cInterlude: Awkward Desire.\u201d The pattering drum kicks paired with Gabor\u2019s anti-gravity lulls create a brief out-of-body experience that could last longer. But the album is her universe and all of her feelings have a rightful place.\n", "pptitle": ["fantasi", "fact"]}
