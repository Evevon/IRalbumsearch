Long drives were a part of her routine when living in small-town Silsbee, TX., and the isolating mobility of her extensive touring as Lomelda led to the inspiration for her 2017 album Thx. But the road is more than just a means to her physical destination\u2014it cultivated a fixation with communication and understanding, which were hefty themes on Thx and have continued to provide fodder for new songs. Now, after transplanting herself to Los Angeles, Read takes a more contemplative turn, embracing brevity and modest production on her newest album M for Empathy.\nWithin her album\u2019s very short sixteen minutes, Read reminds us of the intricacies and nuances of empathy. The task of understanding others is arduous: Read\u2019s empathy is not a political magic bullet, but a personal exploration. On the opener \u201cTalk,\u201d she mentions her move to the Golden State as if she\u2019s moving a few buildings down. \u201cI need to be over there, four states a step a way,\u201d she sings carefully. Her voice will make the 1,700-mile trek, communicating with those she\u2019s moving closer to and those she\u2019s traveling farther from.\nRead cultivates a cozy pocket of sound for her choice topic\u2019s delicate nature. Piano keys cascade during \u201cBust\u201d and then glint on \u201cM for Mush\u201d; acoustic guitar strums are round and woody on \u201cTell\u201d and then are bright and steady on \u201cSo Bad 2, Care.\u201d With the help of her brother Tommy, Read stretches the calming tones and comforting sentimentality of these two instruments.  As a lyricist, Read uses small, poignant sentence fragments, repetition, and wordplay with incredible precision, capturing intimate snapshots within tiny frameworks. Despite the songs\u2019 short lifespan\u2014a minute and half on average\u2014they feel expansive, shapeshifting like shadow puppets on a wall. \u201cI thought of so many things to say to you/But what were they,\u201d Read wonders aloud on \u201cBust.\u201d  She repeats the latter fragment three times before tagging on \u201cto you,\u201d a subtle semantic layer that underscores the two-way mirror effect of trying to understand someone else\u2019s perspective.\nShe takes some wild lyrical risks on the stunning \u201cM for Mush\u201d: \u201cMust make myself a mold to hold my mushin magic mercy mind,\u201d she sings.  Here, empathy is as pliable as playing with Play-Doh. But, M for Empathy\u2019s most potent moments are when Read travels vast space, whether through an instrumental transition or an existential concern. Misunderstanding is not the only obstacle to empathy\u2014death also has a troublesome way of intervening.\u201cWhat If I die before I get to know ya more?\u201d she asks on \u201cM for Me,\u201d her voice fragile.\nRead understands that in many ways empathy is not completely possible. It\u2019s not as simple as saying \u201cI understand,\u201d but reaching out to others and possibly saving someone\u2019s life\u2014on \u201cSlide,\u201d Read sings about depression and a friend\u2019s phone call that saved her. She doesn\u2019t perform empathy here; she investigates it. By erasing the extraneous detail from her lyrics, she leaves space for our imagination and even some room for us to insert ourselves.\n", "pptitle": ["m", "empathi"]}
