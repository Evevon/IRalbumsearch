The music seems designed to overwhelm you with unnamable feelings: I am sad and I listen to Loveless Every Night is the name of a Facebook group, yes, but it\u2019s also a lifestyle. Even the brightest songs by the Cocteau Twins carry an undertow of sorrow. Sasami Ashworth\u2019s shoegaze invokes similar feelings; the Los Angeles-based polymath has made her name over the years as the synth player in Cherry Glazerr. Her debut record, SASAMI, is a union of synthesizer decay and guitar reverb that embodies shoegaze\u2019s supernatural ability to conjure sadness from the void.\nAshworth has described her songwriting process as akin to drafting a long, angry text in the Notes section of an iPhone and then letting it simmer\u2014although when listening to this record the first few times that\u2019s not entirely clear. It\u2019s easy to mistake SASAMI as a gentle, soothing album, but then the words begin to creep their way out of the ground, and Ashworth\u2019s dark heart begins to reveal itself.  Take a song like \u201cNot the Time\u201d; on first blush, it seems a bit benign. Its smartly hemmed guitar parts glow like an Asobi Seksu track while Sasami sounds uncannily like Trish Keenan. But as you crawl further inside, the song reveals complexities: \u201cEven though we tried to make it work, it doesn\u2019t/Even though each time it only hurts for a moment,\u201d she sings. The arrangement practically bleeds empty space\u2014prismatic guitar work from Ashworth\u2019s brother, JooJoo, stretches out into the far corners of the mix, while the percussion from Cameron Allen sounds as weightless as a moth fluttering around an attic.\nThere are moments when Ashworth seems too comfortable with a default prettiness. She is incredibly adept at writing lovely melodies and synth parts, but the most exciting moments come when she threatens to break loose. On \u201cFree,\u201d Ashworth\u2019s vocals quiver, as if she\u2019s containing herself in front of someone who has broken her heart. \u201cThe city held us as its own/We walked as far as we could go/We had to choose, so we took off our shoes,\u201d she sings as her accompaniment grows noisier, moving into space-rock territory. The first single, \u201cCallous,\u201d burns with the cosmic energy of Souvlaki-era Slowdive. The cycle of memories she explores here are especially gutting: \u201cI lost my callouses for you/And you didn\u2019t even ask me how my day was.\u201d Even the tracks that scan as crowd pleasers, like \u201cAdult Contemporary,\u201d which features an ensemble cast of musicians like Soko and Hand Habits\u2019 Meg Duffy, are deeply personal.\nListening to Ashworth unpack her relationships can verge on voyeurism. Writing about sadness and suffering is difficult to do, especially in the space of a debut album, when you are still figuring out what to say and how to say it. But dig beneath the surface of her songs, and the bitter secrets she has buried there bloom. Sometimes Ashworth sounds like she\u2019s yearning to startle her own music\u2019s hypnotically pleasant surface, and there are times you wonder if the gauziness of shoegaze is doing her a disservice, hiding her in plain sight. But SASAMI is a powerful first effort, and Ashworth is a compelling presence. Shoegaze was named because its practitioners supposedly couldn\u2019t meet your eye, but if you spend long enough with SASAMI you will find Ashworth staring right out at you.\n", "pptitle": ["sasami"]}
