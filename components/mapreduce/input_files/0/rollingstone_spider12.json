By 2013, with Holy Fire, they smoothed and super-sized their sound with production from U2 vets Flood and Alan Moulder. Their latest LP finds Foals mostly self-producing, with help from engineer Brett Shaw (Florence and The Machine, Robyn), and swinging for what used to be the fences on a proggy, ambitious project; part two is due this fall.\r\n\r\nBless \u2018em for their ambition, and too bad it didn\u2019t yield more than this muddled set. So far, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost reads as a post-apocalyptic song cycle about life after an eco-disaster, where \u201csand dunes fill up all our towns,\u201d and \u201crobots have made the rounds\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s no birds left to fly\u201d \u2014 thought curiously, we later learn \u201cthe birds are all singing \u2018It's the end of the world.\u2019\u201d (Perhaps they\u2019re penguins, still struggling with identity issues.) Trump, or recovered memories of him, continues to haunt. A reference to the Sargasso Sea could be a literary nod, a shout-out to the North Atlantic Garbage Patch, a reverie of privileged movements in the Bahamas, or just a portentiously unmoored signifier. Conceptually, the LP comes off at best as a less multi-cultural Damon Albarn project; it worst, it\u2019s Coldplay reimagining Tales From Topographic Oceans.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, Foals can still bring compelling grooves: see the percussion-spiked funk of \u201cIn Degrees\u201d and the glistening \u201cCaf\u00e9 D\u2019Athens,\u201d whose dubby marimba vibe recalls Tortoise, A Certain Ratio, and the sort of rangy late-20th century rock music the band used to conjure regularly. Here, it\u2019s a detour on what\u2019s otherwise a generic throwback \u2014 not as slavish in its retreads as Greta Van Fleet, but a drag from a band capable of more. We\u2019ll see what\u2019s up with Pt. 2.", "pptitle": ["review", "foal", "apocalypt", "save", "lost", "pt", "1", "roll", "stone"]}
