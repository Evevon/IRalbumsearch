[Find it here]\r\n\r\n\u201cAll I Need\u201d is one of several previously unheard originals on this collection of raw home demos recorded in the early Seventies, when the famously self-destructive songwriter was at the height of his creative powers. On would-be classics like \u201cRex\u2019s Blues\u201d and \u201cPancho & Lefty\" Van Zandt, not yet thirty years old at the time, sounds impossibly world-weary. Either due to their low-fidelity or the simple spontaneity of the recordings themselves, there are a few moments, such as \u201cThe Hills of Roane County,\u201d in which Van Zandt sounds nearly as exhausted as he would 20 years later, when the songwriter often struggled to merely get through gigs.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut for the most part, Van Zandt sounds focused, alert and, most of all, relaxed, on this occasionally revelatory collection of covers, rough-draft takes on future classics and previously unreleased gems. Never more so is this the case than on several of the album\u2019s rare covers: On Richard Dobson\u2019s \u201cForever, For Always, For Certain,\u201d Van Zandt sounds like he\u2019s discovering the song\u2019s lonesome wisdom in real time, delighting in Dobson\u2019s wistful wordplay. When he takes on Tom Paxton\u2019s \u201cLast Thing On My Mind,\u201d he turns the Sixties folk standard into a dark country dirge. \r\n\r\nOn Sky Blue, Van Zandt rarely sounds as perfectly in command of his material as he would just a year or so later, on 1977's Live at the Old Quarter, Houston, Texas. Instead, in this private home recording session-turned-album, full of pain and beauty, he merely sounds like himself: tormented, tremendous, forever trying to break through his chains with a song.", "pptitle": ["town", "van", "zandt", "demo", "sky", "blue", "review", "roll", "stone"]}
