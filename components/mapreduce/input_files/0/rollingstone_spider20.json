It\u2019s there to remind her \u2014 and us \u2014 how to remain grounded while moving forward. With\u00a0When I Get Home, she pays tribute to her roots in Houston by presenting a therapeutic and transfixing scrapbook that seamlessly brings together the past and the future of her home.\n\nWith 19 songs the clock in at under 40 minutes total, Solange\u2019s tribute takes an unusual form. She offers brief but potent statements; over half the tracks are under three minutes and each one bleeds into the other like watercolors on her canvas. Even more interestingly, the album, even with its short, punk-length songs, never feels rushed. In fact, it moves like molasses even when the flo and the freak\u2019n get the BPM up ever so slightly. Every moment, beat, sample and feature feel carefully constructed and articulated, and for Solange, that\u2019s just her default mode of creation.\n\nLaunching with the wistful \u201cThings I Imagined,\u201d\u00a0When I Get Home\u00a0unfolds a much dreamier, less introspective collection than her watershed 2016 LP\u00a0A Seat at the Table. If her preceding release was her statement of purpose on black female identity,\u00a0When I Get Home\u00a0is her putting those thesis points into action. It\u2019s the product of a woman set free that not only imagines but enforces an existence that is untethered to anything but the place where she feels she belongs at that moment.\n\nLike Solange herself, the music on Home\u00a0is unrestrained and freeform. It\u2019s jazzy, funky, brassy and warm. It can be soft and earnest, as on a track like the subdued but open \u201cDreams.\u201d Other times, it is bold and candy-painted like the cars she passed every day while growing up in the Third Ward (see the body-roll ready, Metro Boomin-assisted \u201cStay Flo\u201d). Across the board, she balances her roles as both R&B priestess burning sage over the world\u2019s chaos and amenable kickback hostess keeping the brown liquor pouring all night with such ease that by the end of\u00a0Home, her modes of music become absolutely indistinguishable from one another.\n\nGuests pop up like old friends stopping in to say hello. Panda Bear, Tyler, the Creator, Gucci Mane, Playboi Carti, Abra and more offer seemingly unassuming but incredibly meaningful appearances, harmonizing effortlessly with the master of ceremonies. In Solange\u2019s world, a collaborator doesn\u2019t just absorb the vision she\u2019s presenting, they help inspire it. Even the album's samples -- Diamond and Princess of Crime Mobb\u2019s playful fight for the microphone and Goddess Lula Belle\u2019s reassuring reminder to \u201cdo nothing without intention\u201d -- become more than just support for Solange\u2019s points; by serving as independent interludes they are statements in themselves.\n\nSolange\u2019s growth as an artist has been one of music\u2019s most fascinating stories, and, like\u00a0A Seat at the Table,\u00a0When I Get Home\u00a0serves as a thrilling reminder that this is just the beginning of the futures she still has yet to unpack. If she can make a party-friendly album so meaningful, we\u2019ve barely even witnessed the tip of her vision.", "pptitle": ["review", "solang", "home", "tribut", "nativ", "houston", "roll", "stone"]}
