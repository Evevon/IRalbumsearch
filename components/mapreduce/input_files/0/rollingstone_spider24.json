His first two offerings \u2014 2012\u2019s\u00a0Blak and Blu and 2015\u2019s\u00a0The Story of Sonny Boy Slim \u2014\u00a0were steeped in a sleek, modern blues-rock production style that mostly failed to capture the thrilling dynamics of his live show.\u00a0\r\n\r\nClark\u2019s third major-label LP,\u00a0This Land,\u00a0arrives as an ambitious corrective. This is the first time it\u2019s felt like the singer-guitarist is embracing the possibilities of studio production as a creative asset rather than a nuisance. In place of copious guitar solos, we get bass synths, keyboards, and a series of programmed samples that add a convincing contemporary accent to the survey of genres (Eighties R&B, funk, rockabilly, punk, reggae) Clark draws from this time.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHis studio experimentation has also led to an outpouring of songwriting.  \u201cExploitation wants me to be the same,\u201d as he puts it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere are two dominant narrative threads contained within\u00a0This Land: one, a collection of private confessionals that meditate on success, marriage\u00a0and\u00a0fatherhood; the other, an embittered series of pleas for social justice in which Clark dives into political songwriting in ways he\u2019s never come close to before.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe latter group of songs, anchored by the righteously indignant, prog-funk title track and the cautionary tale of \u201cWhat About Us,\u201d is impressive, and these will likely serve as the album\u2019s main draw. But it\u2019s during the former batch when Clark sounds most himself. On a series of guilt-ridden songs about leaving his family for the road, the Texas guitarist offers moving repentance. Highlights like \u201cPearl Cadillac\u201d and \u201cGuitar Man\u201d are pop triumphs, full of lust and redemption, that split the difference between Miguel, Prince and Stevie Wonder.\u00a0\r\n\r\nElsewhere, though, Clark\u2019s approach to songcraft remains a relative work-in-progress. There are moments of heightened emotional depth, like when he declares, \u201cI walk alone because \u2018alone\u2019 won\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry.\u201d But as a songwriter, Clark is still prone to clunky clich\u00e9 (\u201cYou got me feeling like a million bucks/Make me wanna fall in love\u201d). On the Marvin Gaye pastiche \u201cFeed the Babies,\u201d his social commentary simply feels trite: \u201cThe world is my buffet,\u201d Clark sings over a light funk groove, \u201cand I\u2019m just looking to eat.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt 17 tracks,\u00a0This Land\u00a0feels packed with too many ideas, only some of them landing. At its best, though, the album points to a new way forward for Clark. It\u2019s a crucial stride for an artist who\u2019s long been searching for direction.", "pptitle": ["review", "gari", "clark", "jr", "land", "roll", "stone"]}
