There's a slow-moving density to this album, broken up with occasional bursts of pop energy: the early-Wilco roots rock that guides \u201cSwamp and Bay,\u201d the swinging Nineties riff on \u201cLucky Joke.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat Chaos Is Imaginary also marks a lyrical and creative breakthrough for Tucker, who, singing in a newly low vocal register, addresses much of the album to an undefined second-person figure. \u201cCreate the vague you need/And get married in the seams,\u201d Tucker sings on the album finale \u201cRoses.\u201d \u201cCome and lay on top of me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThroughout the album, Girlpool illustrate the struggles of navigating expectations amidst the personal and musical changes Tucker and Tividad have undergone in the past few years. The result is an impressive balancing act, a sound grounded in the band\u2019s tradition that is nevertheless constantly pushing forward. \u201cThey see you how they want to,\u201d as the group puts it, \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to try.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erXHphAfXj0", "pptitle": ["girlpool", "chao", "imaginari", "album", "review", "roll", "stone"]}
