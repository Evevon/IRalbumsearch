Her style blossomed on her 2015 follow-up, On Your Own Love Again, with stranger melodies (one song is even called \u201cStrange Melody\u201d) and spacier arrangements. Quiet Signs, her third LP, expands her sound still further. \u201cOpening Night\u201d begins with a piano incantation, idly conjuring Satie\u2019s Gymnop\u00e9dies and Gershwin\u2019s \u201cSummertime.\u201d It segueways into \u201cAs The World Turns,\u201d echoing the same chords, but plucked and strummed on her hushed trademark nylon string guitar \u2014 tentatively, like she\u2019s recalling a dream. With lyrics sung in her trembling elfin warble, the song sits with an abstracted uneasiness; \u201can outline born of fear\u201d is rhymed with \u201cI won't find solace here.\u201d Yet the effect is nothing if not solacing: buoyed by reverb, lapsing from language into humming, creating a sacred space, paradoxically, to ponder anxiety in peace.\r\n\r\nQuiet Signs paints its hazy emotional landscapes with a perpetual sense that bad things are on the horizon, but with a quietly heroic determination to keep them at bay. \u201cTry to keep my worries safe from where they'll do you harm,\u201d she sings on \u201cHere My Love,\u201d adding \u201cbut I can't be sure.\u201d Flutes, organs and synthesizers color music that feels rooted less in the folk revival than in early Sixties film themes and bossa nova; sometimes the vibe also recalls English eccentrics like Nick Drake and Robin Williamson\u2019s Incredible String Band (as a young musician, Pratt had confessed to being \u201cobsessed\u201d with the latter).\r\n\r\nThe record\u2019s nine songs clock in at just 28 minutes total, which feels just right, the samey-ness among songs playing as a strength, conjuring a mood and maintaining it, yet never feeling predictable, in part because it\u2019s hard to get a bead on precisely what each song is about. You might play the set on repeat, in hopes of getting to the bottom of it. Yet it never quite reveals itself. And when Pratt sings \u201cThe halfway blues hang on/ Sure enough a sorry angel/ Hurrying a song on her way,\u201d on \u201cThis Time Around,\u201d you can imagine her as that strange angel, channeling halfway blues into a shared magic.", "pptitle": ["review", "indiefolk", "dream", "space", "jessica", "pratt", "quiet", "sign", "roll", "stone"]}
