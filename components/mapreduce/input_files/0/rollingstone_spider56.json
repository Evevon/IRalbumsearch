Unlike most of his 70\u2019s singer-songwriter contemporaries, the 73 year-old's output has only increased with age. The singer has sprinkled occasional moments of brilliance (see 2016\u2019s Keep Me Singing) amongst a series of pseudo-combative musical statements and records whose winking titles (Reworking the Catalog, Versatile) convey their seemingly tossed-off nature. Not a surprising move from a guy who released a record called A Period of Transition, in 1977.\r\nMorrison\u2019s most recent efforts have tended towards some mix of jazz standards and interpretations of older originals. These records, as well-executed and occasionally expressive as they are, can also come across as so stubbornly self-interested that it can be hard not to view them as part of Morrison\u2019s larger project of turning his late-career into a series of gestures of indifference, none more perverse than the fact that the legendary songwriter has included re-recordings of his 1993 instrumental filler \u201cClose Enough For Jazz\u201d on not one but two separate studio albums in just six years.\r\nEnter The Prophet Speaks, the fourth jazz standard-heavy album Morrison has released in just 14 months. Of those four LPs, Van\u2019s latest contains the highest number of fresh originals, with nearly half the album comprising new material. There are some genuine highlights: the breezy \u201cGot To Go Where the Love Is\u201d sounds like a lost 70\u2019s R&B gem, and \u201cAin\u2019t Gonna Moan No More\u201d is a restless blues that finds old-man Van meditating on a life of musical worship.\r\nMorrison once again uses his latest collection as an occasion to make a point about genre and influence. If Morrison has wanted to communicate anything, it\u2019s that he\u2019s able to write old-time originals that are mostly indistinguishable from the John Lee Hooker, Willie Dixon and Solomon Burke covers they are nestled in between his own songs. It can still be moving to hear Morrison revert back to his primordial roots, to hear him still so innocently inspired and reverent of his idols despite the half-century worth of perspective he now brings to the material. On his cover of \u201cLaughin and Clownin,\u201d Morrison\u2019s voice cracks and moans its way through Sam Cooke\u2019s twilight blues, imbuing the song with a new profundity.\r\nBut aside from a few such moments,The Prophet Speaks\u00a0feels like another headstrong gesture of self-determination from an artist has spent his entire career resisting terms like \u201csinger-songwriter\u201d and \u201crock music. Morrison's latest is further proof that he's still one of the most moving, unrivaled singers of his generation, but it's hard not to wonder what would happen if he embraced his inner-mystic songwriting voice once more.", "pptitle": ["review", "van", "morrison", "prophet", "speak", "mix", "standard", "fresh", "origin", "roll", "stone"]}
