His beats are so sublime, jazz composer Vijay Iyer wrote a tribute to him (see \u201cHood\u201d). This hour-plus mix in the DJ Kicks series \u2013 dependably-curated by the Berlin-based !K7 label for nearly 25 years now \u2013 shows Hood remains a master of darkly minimalist dancefloor bliss. Compared to the bullet-train rub and tug of modern big-box EDM, this music is a tantric escalator, with tiered builds and rolls climbing stealthily and peaks that reveal themselves like mountain-tops from cloud cover.\r\nAnd so it goes here, Hood shuffling his own jams with those of younger peers. Its ecstatic crescendos really start pumping around the 50 minute mark, by which time they feel fully earned, arriving with\u00a0Adrian Hour\u2019s tech-housey \u201cMake You Feel Good,\u201d pitched up for good measure, and\u00a0wrapping up with the helium snares of Matrixxman\u2019s \u201cProtocol,\u201d which send the mix into the dawn\u2019s early light. It\u2019s a fantastic denouement. But as with all great dance music, this set is more about the journey than the destination.", "pptitle": ["review", "robert", "hood", "chase", "dark", "dancefloor", "bliss", "new", "dj", "kick", "mix", "roll", "stone"]}
