Her deep, complex voice is cuts through the darkness with ease. Her latest, Negative Capability, continues her long string of late-career masterworks. She revisits her breakthrough hit, \u201cAs Tears Go By,\u201d but the world-weariness of her voice gives it new depth, and she does the same with Broken English\u2019s \u201cWitches\u2019 Song\u201d but turns it into an almost uplifting folk song. Nick Cave wrote the music for her Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream riff, \u201cThe Gypsy Faerie Queen,\u201d and Mark Lanegan did the same for \u201cThey Come at Night,\u201d a vehicle for her anger after the Bataclan attack. There are also moments of tenderness (\u201cNo Moon at Night\u201d) and vulnerability (\u201cMisunderstanding,\u201d \u201cIn My Own Particular Way\u201d) that make it one of her most compelling albums to date.", "pptitle": ["review", "mariann", "faithful", "deliv", "latecar", "masterwork", "neg", "capabl", "roll", "stone"]}
