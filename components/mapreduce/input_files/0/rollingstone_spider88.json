His story, and his willingness to throw any sound into his mix, makes the tattooed, biracial Brown an ideal male country star for this moment; the definition of \u201ccountry\u201d is expanding, bringing in ideas from hip-pop and synth-EDM and incorporating collaborations with pop stars (in Brown\u2019s case, Camila Cabello) while also remaining true to its storytelling and humanism.\r\n\r\nExperiment\u00a0is Brown\u2019s second album, but it\u2019s rightly being pitched as his breakthrough to a mass audience. Storming stadium-sized drums accompany his opening plea on \u201cCome Back to Me,\u201d but they\u2019re quickly joined by harmonies straight out of the Grand Ole Opry\u2019s playbook and heavy riffing. While big chunks of\u00a0Experiment, like the come-hither \u201cLose It\u201d and the Goo Goo Dolls-gone-Nashville ballad \u201cIt Ain\u2019t You It\u2019s Me,\u201d revel in that liminal space between stadium-sized country and big-tent arena rock,\u00a0Experiment\u00a0also throws a few curveballs. Some are throwbacks: \u201cShort Skirt Weather\u201d is an homage to the line-dancing era, its boot-scooting rhythm accentuated by rollicking pianos and winking fiddles, while the delicately infatuated ballad \u201cGood to You\u201d seems made for wedding entrances, with its pledges of fealty and steady, strolling beat. Others embrace modern pop ideals; the chorus of \u201cWeekend\u201d gets its muscle from mashed synth hits, while \u201cMy Where I Come From\u201d combines the sweeping guitars of \u201890s acoustic-pop and the whooping of post-millennial pop with a plea to anyone ready to judge him for his looks: \u201cSo if I just won't turn down on a Saturday night/ And if I never learn how to back down from a fight/ And if I take my hat off for the stars and the stripes/ And If I just can't seem to shut it down/ That's just my \u2018where I come from' comin\u2019 out,\u201d Brown declares.\r\n\r\n\u201cAmerican Bad Dream\u201d is the album\u2019s emotional center, a minor-key country-rock ballad in which Brown\u2019s baritone is equally stern and desparing. The 25-year-old reminisces about the decade-ish \u201cold days\u201d of being in ninth grade before mass shooter drills and points his finger at \u201cbad cops [who] played the jury\u201d and poisoned the water: \u201cIt's like I just closed my eyes/ Everybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise,\u201d he wails. On an album that, in large part, succeeds because of the way it defies observers\u2019 expectations about \u201cauthenticity,\u201d \u201cAmerican Bad Dream\u201d is a particular triumph, Brown\u2019s confusion mirrored by the rumbles surrounding him and amplified by his own delivery. When\u00a0Experiment\u00a0channels that kind of musical confidence, which it does often, it proves why Brown has become one of the genre\u2019s hottest up-and-comers \u2014 and why he had to forge his own path in order to achieve that position.", "pptitle": ["review", "kane", "brown", "forg", "path", "countri", "stardom", "experi", "roll", "stone"]}
