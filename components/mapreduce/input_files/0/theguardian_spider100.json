His solo repertory ranges from Bach to Boulez, and his recordings reflect that span, yet this is Tiberghien\u2019s first foray into Liszt on record. His selection is typically thoughtful, avoiding the barnstorming, high-Romantic pieces and concentrating instead on music that Liszt composed in the last decade or so of his life.\nThe seven numbers that make up the third book of the Ann\u00e9es de P\u00e8lerinage were mostly composed in the 1870s (only the penultimate Marche Fun\u00e8bre is earlier), and are very different from the pieces in the two previous volumes, which had appeared two decades earlier. Their mood is more contemplative, and their language more forward-looking, sometimes \u2013 as in the most famous of the set, Les Jeux d\u2019Eau \u00e0 la Villa d\u2019Este \u2013 tending towards the world of Debussy and Ravel, sometimes even hinting at the expressionism of the Second Viennese School.\nEach is a scaled-down tone poem, which poses its own set of technical challenges. But Tiberghien never flaunts his total command of those challenges and with an exemplary range of touch and keyboard colour, concentrates instead on these pieces purely as musical statements. It\u2019s logical too for him to complete his collection with six of Liszt\u2019s piano pieces from the 1880s, including the Bagatelle sans Tonalit\u00e9, the troubled nocturne Schlaflos! Frage und Antwort, the Tristan-haunted second of the Lugubre Gondola sequence, and the unfinished fourth Mephisto Waltz. It\u2019s music in which everything becomes enigmatic and ambiguous, and which regularly loses its tonal bearings; Tiberghien presents all of them as perfectly conceived miniatures that often pose more questions than they answer.\nThe 12 Transcendental Studies, which reached their final form in 1852, a quarter of a century after they were conceived, are the epitome of Liszt\u2019s early bravura style. New accounts of the complete set from Boris Giltburg on Naxos and Andrey Gugnin for Piano Classics make a fascinating comparison.\nThough the overall timings of the two versions are within a few seconds of each other, their approaches are often sharply contrasted \u2013 Giltburg the more measured, Gugnin generally favouring extremes of fast and slow.\nThere\u2019s no doubting the virtuosity of the two pianists, but neither of them probes far beneath the music\u2019s glittering surfaces; comparisons with Daniil Trifonov\u2019s dazzling 2016 accounts of the studies quickly reveal what\u2019s missing in both.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nClassical music\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranz Liszt\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["liszt", "ann", "plerinag", "troisim", "ann", "review", "exemplari", "command", "colour", "music", "guardian"]}
