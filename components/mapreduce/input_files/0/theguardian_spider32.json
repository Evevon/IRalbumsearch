Although she has issued more than a dozen albums since her 1984 debut, her dedication finds fresh inspiration and expression on Hollowbone, which mixes pipes and fiddles with mandolin, synth and accordion, and leans towards songs and vocals. It\u2019s a clever shape-shifter of a record, founded on an exceptional five-piece band but unafraid to veer into a cappella voices and ambient moods.\nFrom tradition come instrumentals such as Morpeth and Cockle Bridge alongside Old Stones, Tickell\u2019s homage to Lindisfarne, one part reflective and eerie, one part wild jig. Oldest of all is Nemesis, a piece handed down from Emperor Hadrian\u2019s favourite musician, with its tribute to the \u201cdark-eyed daughter of justice\u201d reshaped for modern times. There\u2019s an old mining song in geordie dialect, Colliers, an antique rhyme, Aboot the Bush, suffused in synth and fractured rhythm and a poem from Tickell\u2019s father, Holywell Pool, delivered like an incantation by female harmonies. A hollowbone is apparently a shamanic instrument for channelling ancient voices; a perfect title.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nFolk music\n\n\n\n\nThe Observer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["kathryn", "tickel", "darken", "hollowbon", "review", "clever", "shapeshift", "record", "music", "guardian"]}
