Critics hailed Maren Morris\u2019s 2016 debut, Hero, for her repudiation of country tropes, and for convincingly aligning Nashville craft with pop scale. But then she found commercial success with The Middle, a thrillingly weird post-EDM collaboration with producer Zedd that seemed to suggest country as her stopover on the way to the mainstream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Maren Morris: Girl album artwork\n\n\nGirl, Morris\u2019s second album, ultimately traffics in neither gutsy grandstanding nor Vegas-adjacent pop. Morris\u2019s co-writers remain blue-chip Nashville, among them Ryan Hurd, whom she married last year. Their relationship underpins Girl, represented as a romance for the ages (Great Ones), salvation (Gold Love) and an enduring sugar rush (the self-explanatory Make Out With Me). But for all the biographical sincerity, Morris\u2019s songs about unfettered good times feel unconvincing.Morris has a compellingly hardbitten voice that\u2019s wasted on the boozy camaraderie of All My Favourite People and the blown-out Flavour, not to mention the twee, plinky-plonky A Song for Everything, which strings together nostalgic tropes to push cheap emotional buttons. \u201cMy first lighter up was back when Coldplay still played clubs,\u201d Morris sings, which seems unlikely given that she was about nine then. None of them are strong enough to tower over their flaws.Also disappointing is Common, featuring Brandi Carlile, a gothic plea for unity that feels feeble next to Morris\u2019s brazen (for a country star) real-life proclamations on gun control. It\u2019s stranger still because the best songs on Girl dwell on friction. \u201cWhat\u2019s left of my halo\u2019s black / Lucky for me, your kind of heaven\u2019s been to hell and back,\u201d she sings on To Hell & Back, a bittersweet, pragmatic love song that swells between anxiety and mellow reassurance, while The Bones draws out the inherent ruefulness in her voice.This relative disappointment recalls Kacey Musgraves following the sparky Same Trailer, Different Park with the underwhelming Pageant Material. But then, Musgraves\u2019s next move was the psychedelic Golden Hour, hailed by many as 2018\u2019s best album. Hopefully the same uptick in inspiration befalls Morris.\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nMaren Morris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\n\n\n\n\nPop and rock\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["maren", "morri", "girl", "review", "countri", "pop", "stuck", "middl", "music", "guardian"]}
