He thus enters 2019 as one of America\u2019s most-fancied MCs, and this debut solo album \u2013 thoughtful, affecting and quietly proud \u2013 justifies the hype.The Young Thug influence is admittedly clear: while Gunna doesn\u2019t have the same wizened vocal idiosyncrasies, he shares his rather disconsolate bearing. If you read the lyrics on their own, you\u2019d think he was as triumphant as a turned-up pop rapper: it\u2019s a roll-call of material success, including an endless stream of \u201cforeigns\u201d, continuing the ongoing rapper fetish for non-US cars that must have General Motors\u2019 marketing department covered in anxious Post-Its. But delivered in that plaintive tone, he suggests a man either dismayed at the spiritual void in his newfound wealth, or one damaged by the struggles that came before it. \u201cSometimes a gangsta need a hug,\u201d he admits on Who You Foolin\u2019; \u201cWe locked in the ghetto forever\u201d asserts Lil Baby on Derek Fisher, despite having revelled in diamonds and cars at the start of his guest verse.\n\n\n\nThese tracks are delivered in the Atlanta style of obsessively repeated single melodies, whose seductive monotony enhances the sense of a downbeat quest for meaning. Gunna deploys another Atlantan innovation, the ad-libs of Migos where the final word of each line is emphatically repeated, but gives it a powerful spin. He stretches the ad-libs out and overlaps them, letting them spill into the next bar: the effect, as on the nominatively deterministic track Outstanding, is an impressionistic swim of words, further blurred by his smudged enunciation. Gunna is known for championing the slang term \u201cdrip\u201d to describe his ever-stylish garms; his delivery chimes perfectly with the aquatic metaphor.The production by Wheezy and Turbo the Great is exceptional, adding delicate string flourishes \u2013 like a koto, or an echoing guitar that sounds like Arthur Russell\u2019s cello \u2013 to the spacious trap architecture. The result is a gentle, poised record: the perfect rap album for a bruised America.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nRap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHip-hop\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["gunna", "drip", "drown", "2", "review", "pois", "plangent", "atlantan", "justifi", "hype", "music", "guardian"]}
