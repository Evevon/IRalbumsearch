So yes: a barrel of laughs. But truly, in among the scab- and finger-picking and lines that creep into your ear and needle (\u201cDo you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?\u201d Jacklin wonders among the watercolour chord progressions of Body) are indeed blasts of bitter humour. In the rollicking You Were Right, reminiscent of Liz Phair or Courtney Barnett, she deftly skewers the sort of boyfriend who gets a kick out of \u201ceducating\u201d, exulting in visiting his favourite restaurants and listening to his favourite bands alone and on her own terms.\nIt\u2019s the ghostliest songs that\u2019ll stay with you, though, from the soft piano and slo-mo catastrophe of When the Family Flies In to the obsessive elegy for a dying relationship in Don\u2019t Know How to Keep Loving You, where Jacklin ponders \u201cwhat if I cleaned up, what if I worked on my skin? I could scrub until I am red-hot weak and thin\u201d. But it\u2019s a weight that\u2019s a pleasure to bear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nWatch the video of Body by Julia Jacklin.\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nAmericana\n\n\n\n\nThe Observer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop and rock\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["julia", "jacklin", "crush", "review", "ghostli", "rollick", "second", "album", "music", "guardian"]}
