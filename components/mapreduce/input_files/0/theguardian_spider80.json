impressive, it also acts like a gilded cage. On her first three albums, peppered as they were with gold-plated bangers, Grande acted more as an athlete, flexing her vocal muscles on songs precision-tooled by the likes of producer Max Martin for chart dominance, while revealing very little about the artist behind them. If Taylor Swift\u2019s lyrics demanded to be decoded, Grande\u2019s faded into the background, not helped by her notorious problems with enunciation.\nAll that changed on last year\u2019s Sweetener, an album streaked with hard-worn positivity while haunted by a terrorist attack at Grande\u2019s 2017 Manchester concert that killed 23 people. \u201cHere is my bleeding heart, and here is a trap beat behind it,\u201d is how she described it to Fader.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  The Thank U, Next album cover. Photograph: Publicity image\n\n\nSweetener\u2019s album cover art \u2013 Grande, staring into the middle distance, flipped upside down \u2013 was an instantly meme-able representation of her mindset; attempted stoicism tinged with chaos. That battle also rules over follow-up Thank U, Next, the artwork to which is, as Grande put it on Twitter, \u201cstill upside-down, but this time she kinda fucks w it lol.\u201d While its predecessor touched on a more universal suffering, Thank U, Next picks over personal tragedy following the death of Grande\u2019s ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, and the subsequent dissolution of her relationship with fiance Pete Davidson. Both are name-checked on the album\u2019s title track, a glorious, heartfelt flip of the typical break-up song that favours self-care over spite.\nMiller also permeates album opener Imagine, a yearning ballad, steeped in denial, in which Grande details mundane relationship goals (\u201cStayin\u2019 up all night, order me pad thai\u201d) before crashing back down to earth; \u201cWhy can\u2019t you imagine a world like that?\u201d she sings with a heartbreaking thud. While Sweetener fantasised a utopia Grande hadn\u2019t quite reached, much of Thank U, Next digs deeper into the aftermath. \u201cI won\u2019t say I\u2019m feeling fine / after what I\u2019ve been through I can\u2019t lie\u201d she sings on Fake Smile, a low-slung R&B throwback that hinges on a sample of Wendy Rene\u2019s 1964 single After Laughter (Comes Tears) and covers press intrusion, social anxiety and the pressures of stan culture. The minimal Needy, meanwhile, unravels like a series of confessional, self-aware text messages, the sort that aren\u2019t necessarily asking for a reply. \u201cSorry if I\u2019m up and down a lot,\u201d she sings sweetly, \u201csorry if I say sorry way too much.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nWatch the video for Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I\u2019m Bored\n\n\nThe album\u2019s emotional centrepiece can be found on the double whammy of Ghostin and In My Head, with both songs, you\u2019d imagine, making uneasy listening for Davidson. The former is a gorgeous, featherlight Max Martin production that seems to levitate on a pillow-soft blend of eerie backwards synths and big syrupy strings. Lyrically it details the pain that comes with staying in a relationship despite loving someone else, or even the memory of someone else. Just as she sings: \u201cYou\u2019ve been so understanding, you\u2019ve been so good\u201d the melody flutters slightly, like eyelids blinking away tears. The darker, trap-infused In My Head, meanwhile, focuses on the swirl of lust and confusion created after you fall for the idea of someone, not the reality. \u201cYeah, look at you, boy, I invented you,\u201d she sighs at one point.\n\n\n\nThe themes of self-confession and self-care run throughout the album but there are playful moments, too. The springy, joyous NASA, which harks back to her debut, 2013\u2019s Yours Truly, takes the theme of planetary exploration and turns it into a plea for space (geddit?), while the dancehall-tinged Bloodline, which opens with a quote from her grandma, posits the idea that maybe it\u2019s best to just see how things go relationship-wise and getting engaged after a few months isn\u2019t essential. The closing Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I\u2019m Bored, meanwhile, marries a subterranean click beat and an \u2019N Sync sample with a cheeky lyric about, well, impatiently waiting to hook up with someone who isn\u2019t single.\nArriving less than six months after Sweetener, Thank U, Next could have felt hurried, a dashed-off cash-in to secure Grande\u2019s status as the world\u2019s biggest pop star. Instead, the braggadocious, ice-cold low point 7 Rings aside, it feels more cohesive, the result of a burst of creativity and a prevailing mood as opposed to Sweetener\u2019s crude split down the middle between Pharrell\u2019s trademark sinewy sound and the more pop leanings of Max Martin and his team. While here the production is shared between the likes of Martin, Tommy Brown and Happy Perez, there\u2019s a through line sonically \u2013 a kind of off-kilter, metallic eeriness \u2013 that ties it together.\n\n\n\n\nAriana Grande: a beacon of resilience in her worst and biggest year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrucially, at the centre of it all, perhaps for the first time, is Grande. As with Rihanna\u2019s Anti, this feels like the work of a pop star previously happy to act as conduit for other people, finally working out who they are and what they want to say. Here, Grande finds her voice.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nAriana Grande\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop and rock\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["ariana", "grand", "thank", "u", "review", "breakup", "album", "wit", "wonder", "music", "guardian"]}
