The 72-year-old soul legend has returned to the recording studio and is preparing to head out on tour for the first time in five years. But as Uncut\u2019s Stephen Deusner discovers, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s about to neglect his church duties.Order the latest issue of Uncut online and have it sent to your home!\u201cI caught a monster,\u201d \u2028Green testifies, standing at the pulpit on a Sunday morning earlier this month. \u201cNo, the monster caught me. The cold had me. I didn\u2019t have the cold. The cold said, \u2018Albert, come here!\u2019 I said, \u2018Oh no, you don\u2019t want me! I\u2019ve been healthy for years!\u2019 The doctor had to give me two types of medicine to get over \u2028this thing. And my little throat ain\u2019t over it yet.\u201dIt seems hard to believe any cold, however monstrous, could weaken that throat or tamp down any of Green\u2019s excitement. He lets out a hearty \u201cWhoo!\u201d to let the crowd of roughly 150 church members and tourists know that he\u2019s back in full health. Green bought this church in 1976 and started preaching almost immediately. Most Sundays he\u2019s right behind the pulpit; during the week he often leads Bible study.\u201cI don\u2019t really consider it performing at the Tabernacle,\u201d he tells Uncut a few days later. \u201cI consider it doing my job. Al was called to do gospel music before he started doing pop music. So to me it\u2019s just getting back to my roots. It\u2019s \u2028me saying to Christ Jesus, \u2018I\u2019m tired of being alone. Lord, take me to the RIVER!\u2019\u201d He sings that last word, drawing out those syllables and lifting his voice into that familiar falsetto, undiminished by age or illness. \u201cThat\u2019s what I like. I like the good stuff!\u201d Green doesn\u2019t consider his new single or tour anything like a comeback. \u201cThis is what I do,\u201d he exclaims. \u201cI sing and I do concerts. I\u2019ve been doing this ever since I met Willie Mitchell some place in Texas. I ain\u2019t doing nothing different now from what I was doing then, excerpt for the tabernacle. I\u2019ve been doing that and \u2028I think it\u2019s fantastic.\u201dPreaching every Sunday has obviously kept \u2028his voice in shape, so there\u2019s no dust to shake off, no nerves to steady as he prepares to hit the road. He just has to handle the logistics of gathering a backing band that\u2019s scattered across the country. \u201cI got people from Kansas City, Jacksonville, Boston, Indianapolis. We have to rehearse pretty soon. They keep saying, \u2018We know all the songs but we\u2019d rather go over them with you.\u2019 I just say, \u2018OK. Let\u2019s get together.\u2019\u201dYou can read much more about Al Green in the new issue of Uncut, out tomorrow with Neil Young on the coverSubscribe to Uncut and make huge savings on the cover price \u2013 find out by clicking here!
