Hours later, he was in the band, adding his noisy happenings to Can\u2019s \u2018imperial phase\u2019 run of albums: Soundtracks, Tago Mago, Ege Bamyasi and Future Days.For many, Suzuki\u2019s ecstatic hollers and apocalyptic whispers were central to Can\u2019s antic, otherworldly appeal; the perfect vocal interpretation of the strange rhythmic sorcery being summoned around him. Yet in his new autobiography, I Am Damo Suzuki \u2013 named after The Fall\u2019s heartfelt homage \u2013 he makes clear that his tenure with \u201cThat German Band\u201d was only one aspect of his lifelong mission: to spread peace by making \u201ca kind of music that can communicate directly with the people\u201d. Order the latest issue of Uncut online and have it sent to your home!Before he joined Can, Suzuki was a hippie traveller who left Japan to see if he could make a connection with people on the other side of the world. For the last 25 years or so he\u2019s continued on much the same path, as the only permanent member of Damo Suzuki\u2019s Network. The others are local pick-up musicians or \u2018Sound Carriers\u2019 who typically only meet Suzuki at Soundcheck.Despite battling colon cancer in recent years, Damo Suzuki\u2019s Network is still going strong, with a run of UK dates forthcoming in March.So what do you want to ask one of music\u2019s genuine free spirits?
