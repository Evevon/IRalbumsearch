In a rare and remarkable interview in the latest issue of Uncut \u2013 in shops now and available to order online here \u2013 this most elusive of folk singers talks frankly with Jim Wirth about her extraordinary life, her brief but indelible career, and why it had to end so soon.Order the latest issue of Uncut online and have it sent to your home!\u201cI\u2019ve always been an outside kind of person,\u201d says Briggs.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been a professional gardener in one form and another. I\u2019ve spent the past 20 years outdoors; \u2028I had a contract with the Forestry Commission and then with the Crown Prosecution Service, helping the guys who are doing community service \u2013 keeping their \u2028clients occupied.\u201dIn 11 years as a singer, Briggs released an EP and two full-length albums, as well as recording tracks for two Topic Records compilation albums \u2013 1963\u2019s The Iron Muse and 1966\u2019s saucy The Bird In The Bush \u2013 and 1963 and 1964\u2019s Edinburgh Folk Festival LPs. Even factoring in Sing A Song For You and \u201cFour Songs\u201d \u2013 a more recent EP of pieces scavenged from old radio sessions and a live tape \u2013 her entire recorded output amounts to barely three hours of music. However, the extraordinary power of her voice, supernaturally clear and eternally distant, has given Briggs an abiding appeal like few of her contemporaries. \u201cI love the almost dispassionate delivery of Annie, and the starkness,\u201d modern folk polymath Eliza Carthy tells Uncut. \u201cThe directness of the delivery and the purity of her voice \u2013 it\u2019s like \u2028a dagger. It cuts right through you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all there on the albums,\u201d adds Steve Ashley, Briggs\u2019 long-term friend and one-time collaborator. \u201cYou can still hear that magic. She was also completely unpredictable.\u201dOn bad nights, Briggs dissolved on stage, forgetting lyrics and abandoning songs as she battled with her profoundly ambivalent attitude to performing. She always sang with her eyes tight shut, making no attempt to reach out to the crowd; her transcendent nights might be the ones when she managed to blank the audience out entirely. \u201cI was always singing to myself,\u201d she says, momentarily cheery. \u201cI hated being in front of an audience. I was nervous. I was just so fucking nervous. I\u2019m so fucking nervous being here with you. \u2028I didn\u2019t like being watched. I didn\u2019t like having my photograph taken. Perhaps I felt that I was never empowered to be important.\u201d\u201cI resented hugely, from the age of about 11, the way that girls were treated. I wasn\u2019t allowed to wear trousers! I was a real outdoor girl, out in the woods all the time, and if you haven\u2019t got trousers you just end up with scratched legs.\u201cIn the village I came from I was known as \u2018the Bohemian\u2019,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes. \u201cI was quite hard work for my uncle and aunt, because we were in this little \u2028village community and I wasn\u2019t behaving in the right way. I didn\u2019t \u2028see it that way. I just saw there was an inevitability that I had to pursue all possibilities, and I was particularly pissed off with the \u2028role in life for working-class girls. So pissed off. It was awful.\u201d She twists her fingers. \u201cThat I would be a hairdresser. I was a clever girl! \u2028A hairdresser! That was the aspiration: your own little salon.\u201dSuch was her unworldliness that she spent part of the summer of 1967 living alone on a beach in the west of Ireland, an experience she recounted on her stark signature tune \u201cLiving By The Water\u201d \u2013 key line: \u201cBecause I need no company, I make no enemies.\u201d \u201cI did live on a beach,\u201d she says. \u201cAlone. For several weeks. I was totally happy with that. I didn\u2019t want \u2028to be tied down; anybody putting pressure on me, \u2028I didn\u2019t want it.\u201dYou can read much more from this extraordinary encounter with Anne Briggs in the current issue of Uncut, in shops now with John Lennon on the cover.Subscribe to Uncut and make huge savings on the cover price \u2013 find out by clicking here!
