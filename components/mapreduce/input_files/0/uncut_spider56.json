The footage was originally captured by Michael Lindsay-Hogg for the Let It Be movie.Order the latest issue of Uncut online and have it sent to your home!Peter Jackson says: \u201cThe 55 hours of never-before-seen footage and 140 hours of audio made available to us, ensures this movie will be the ultimate \u2018fly on the wall\u2019 experience that Beatles fans have long dreamt about \u2013 it\u2019s like a time machine transports us back to 1969, and we get to sit in the studio watching these four friends make great music together.\u201cI was relieved to discover the reality is very different to the myth. After reviewing all the footage and audio that Michael Lindsay-Hogg shot 18 months before they broke up, it\u2019s simply an amazing historical treasure-trove. Sure, there\u2019s moments of drama \u2013 but none of the discord this project has long been associated with. Watching John, Paul, George, and Ringo work together, creating now-classic songs from scratch, is not only fascinating \u2013 it\u2019s funny, uplifting and surprisingly intimate.\u201cI\u2019m thrilled and honoured to have been entrusted with this remarkable footage \u2013 making the movie will be a sheer joy.\u201dThe footage will be restored by Park Road Post of Wellington, New Zealand, using techniques developed for Jackson\u2019s recent acclaimed WW1 documentary. The untitled Beatles film is currently in production and the release date will be announced in due course. Following its release, a restored version of the original Let It Be movie directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg will also be made available.Subscribe to Uncut and make huge savings on the cover price \u2013 find out by clicking here!Like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter to keep up to date with the latest news from Uncut.The March 2019 issue of Uncut is now on sale in the UK \u2013 with Leonard Cohen on the cover.
