This long apprenticeship was still providing him with things in the years before he died.\u201dDavid Bowie: Finding Fame features previously unseen interviews with Mick Ronson, Gus Dudgeon and Ken Pitt, plus the last ever interview with Lindsay Kemp, conducted a week before his death. There\u2019s even behind-the-scenes audio of Bowie and Dudgeon recording \u201cThe Laughing Gnome\u201d.Other Bowie footage unearthed for the documentary includes footage previously believed to be lost of Bowie performing Jacques Brel\u2019s \u201cMy Death\u201d on the Russell Harty show. Whately has also tracked down a copy of what many regard as the holy grail of Bowie TV spots \u2013 his performance of \u201cStarman\u201d on ITV\u2019s Lift Off With Ayshea, a few weeks before the famous Top Of The Pops appearance. The original reels were wiped long ago but a fan recorded it on computer tape.
