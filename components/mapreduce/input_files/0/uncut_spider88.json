"New Order have announced the reissue of their debut album in deluxe boxset form.\n\nMovement \u2013 The Definitive Edition includes a bonus CD of previously unreleased tracks plus a DVD of live shows, and will be released on April 5, 2019.Order the latest issue of Uncut online and have it sent to your home!The new issue of Uncut \u2013 in shops tomorrow (December 20) but available to order online now by clicking this link \u2013 features an in-depth interview with all four members of the band about the difficult transition from Joy Division to New Order and the creation of Movement.\u201cPersonally, I didn\u2019t want it to sound like sub-Joy Division, I didn\u2019t want to sound like sub-Ian,\u201d says Bernard Sumner. \u201cIt did feel a little bit like that. But I didn\u2019t really know any better because\u2026 well, we were Joy Division, but without the singer.\u201d\u201cOne of the things I think people liked about New Order in the early days was the shambolic, couldn\u2019t-give-a-fuckness about it,\u201d adds drummer Stephen Morris. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what the fuck we were doing. So we just got pissed and hoped nobody would notice.\u201d\u201cI like a challenge,\u201d continues Sumner. \u201cGive me something difficult to do, if you give me enough time, I\u2019ll be able to do it. Most people would learn to sing, get a bit of experience and then make a record. But I made a record first, as a singer. It wasn\u2019t really the right way to do it. We had to go through that painful experience to come out on the other side. In the end, there was no right way to do it.\u201d Peter Hook left New Order in 2007, but continues to honour their historic works with his new band, The Light. He remains hugely fond of Movement: \u201cTo me, the beauty of Movement is the synchronicity between the three instruments: the six-string bass, the guitar, the drums. When it worked, it was magic. It was all about the three of us clicking in together.\u201dPerhaps inevitably, Sumner takes a different view as he recalls that strange, liminal period when Joy Division became New Order and three friends found some deep, unarticulated solace in the music they made together. \u201cOur attitude was, \u2018Whatever happens, we have to make it work,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the only thing we\u2019ve got.\u2019\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s always been about the future,\u201d he reflects \u201cWithout that attitude I wouldn\u2019t be here today, and we wouldn\u2019t have come up with \u2028tunes like \u2018Blue Monday\u2019 or \u2018Bizarre Love Triangle\u2019 or \u2018Temptation\u2019 or \u2018Everything\u2019s Gone Green\u2019. Right from the early days of Joy Division, \u2028I always had a nagging thought in the back of my head: wouldn\u2019t it be fabulous if you could move music forward?\u201dYou can read much more about the making of Movement in the new issue of Uncut, in shops tomorrow.Peruse the tracklisting for Movement \u2013 The Definitive Edition below:LP / CD1 (original album)   \nDreams Never End\nTruth\nSenses\nChosen Time\nICB\nThe Him\nDoubts Even Here\nDenial               CD2 (previously unreleased tracks)   \nDreams Never End (Western Works Demo)\nHomage (Western Works Demo)\nCeremony (Western Works Demo)\nTruth (Western Works Demo)\nAre You Ready For This?
