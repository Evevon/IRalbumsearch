His breezy debut album Into The Sun was released in 1998 on the Beastie Boys\u2019 uber-cool Grand Royal label, but he\u2019s only released one more solo album since \u2013 2006\u2019s downbeat and quietly impressive Friendly Fire.Instead, Lennon is a serial collaborator, lending his wide-ranging talents to a dizzying range of projects down the years: starting out as a teenager in his mum\u2019s band, he spent the second half of the 90s playing bass for postmodern pop outfit Cibo Matto. Since then he\u2019s worked with everyone from Lana Del Rey to Lady Gaga, Albert Hammond Jr to The Moonlandingz, metal band Soulfly to childhood friend Mark Ronson, as well as releasing three albums of gauzy psych-funk with Charlotte Kemp Muhl as The Ghost Of A Sabre Tooth Tiger.Order the latest issue of Uncut online and have it sent to your home!However, it may be that Lennon has finally found his ideal sparring partner in the unlikely form of Primus\u2019s Les Claypool. The duo are about to release their third album in four years as The Claypool Lennon Delirium, a lavish nu-prog operation, melding cosmic exploration with political satire.Ahead of the release of February\u2019s excellent South Of Reality, Lennon has agreed to answer your questions for our regular Audience With feature. So what do you want to ask the man who counted David Bowie as a father figure, and who in turn has acted as a mentor to those wayward young tykes Fat White Family?
