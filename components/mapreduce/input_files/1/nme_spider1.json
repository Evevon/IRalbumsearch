For this, we are sorry.\u201cAs you might expect, we have already been working cooperatively with our city and county partners to promptly address and resolve these issues. We look forward to offering you a significantly improved transportation experience today and throughout the weekend, and we appreciate the opportunity to earn back your confidence and trust.\u201dThis year\u2019s edition \u2013 the 21st \u2013 was moved to Virginia Key after Ultra failed to renew their lease to operate in its usual downtown spot of Miami\u2019s Bayfront Park.David Guetta, The Chainsmokers, Deadmau5 are some of the acts performing at the 2019 event.", "pptitle": ["day", "miami", "ultra", "music", "festiv", "describ", "fyre", "fest", "20"]}
