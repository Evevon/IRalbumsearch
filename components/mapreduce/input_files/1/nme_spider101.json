But I thought they were kind of a street band, there were lines like \u2018Tarquin\u2019 that would insinuate that they were knocking the middle classes, but it turns out they\u2019re not working class.\u201d\u201cThat offended me, because I then held the belief that they were appropriating, to a certain degree, a working class voice.\u201dWilliamson continued: \u201cObviously that excelled when the second album came out, and I felt a bit cheated. I also became jaded by this idea that we were a band that was campaigning for social justice, when we\u2019re not, we\u2019re just talking about what\u2019s around us.\u201cMusic can\u2019t solve political problems. And I think their take on it is cliched, patronising, insulting and mediocre. And that\u2019s why I have a problem with them. I take music seriously, and I\u2019ve come from a place where this music has been created. Without that, we wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201dHe added: \u201cI went through a lot of pain \u2013 I understand Idles\u2019 singer has gone through a lot of pain. But I don\u2019t believe their slant on this. I don\u2019t like them at all.\u201dNow in a new interview with The Times, guitarist Mark Bowen and singer Joe Talbot addressed Williamson\u2019s accusations. \u201cIf you\u2019re angry about inequality, you have to preach equality as an alternative rather than go, \u2018F*** you, you\u2019re wrong\u2019,\u201d he said.\u201cBecause you\u2019re not going to get anywhere with that. The fact that we\u2019re still talking about the same stuff punks were dealing with in the 1970s means that \u2018F*** you\u2019 thing didn\u2019t work.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no authenticity in just being a prick to everyone,\u201d added Talbot.", "pptitle": ["idl", "respond", "sleaford", "mod", "beef", "there", "authent", "just", "prick"]}
