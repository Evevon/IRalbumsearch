Details of specific venues or how much the singer was going to earn weren\u2019t included, though the shows are thought to have been organised prior to his arrest.The live appearances were said to have been planned to ease the strain of Kelly\u2019s mounting legal fees \u2013 along with child support and everyday expenses. Cancelled shows in\u00a0Illinois and his music being removed from streaming platforms resulted in Kelly\u2019s growing financial struggles.Now, a rare statement from Dubai\u2019s government has denied that any concerts were being planned.\u00a0\u201cAuthorities in Dubai have not received any request for a performance by singer R Kelly nor are there any venues that have been booked,\u201d it read.It\u2019s also stated that the artist \u201chas not been invited by the Dubai royal family for a performance\u201d.Kelly\u2019s lawyer Steven A. Greenberg has responded to the statement in an\u00a0email to\u00a0The Associated Press.\u00a0\u201cMr Kelly had a signed contract with a legitimate promoter, and any information that was included in the motion to travel was from that contract,\u201d he said.\u201cWe did not say he was invited by The royal family, but the contract did provide that he would make himself available to meet with them.\u201dR Kelly pleaded not guilty\u00a0to 10 counts of sexual abuse last month,\u00a0before being released from jail this month on $100,000 bail.Claims of Kelly\u2019s sexual activity with underage girls resurfaced amid the recent\u00a0documentary series,\u00a0Surviving R Kelly.\u00a0Buzzfeed\u00a0had previously reported in 2017 that Kelly ran a sex cult. He has constantly denied any wrongdoing.\u00a0", "pptitle": ["dubai", "govern", "deni", "r", "kelli", "perform", "show", "rare", "statement"]}
