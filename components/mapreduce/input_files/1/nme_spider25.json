He had a career. Why would he do that stuff? It\u2019s kinda the same thing as Bill Cosby \u2013 they only wanted to stop him from getting a TV network like Oprah.\u201cWe should let legends rest, if you don\u2019t have evidence that he did what you\u2019re saying he did. The only evidence we have about Michael Jackson is that we was very talented.\u201dCommenting on T.I.\u2018s recent claims that\u00a0Leaving Neverland is part of an \u201cagenda\u201d to destroy black culture, Juice said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t agree more\u201d with Tip\u2019s opinion.\u201cAt the same time, though,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople are crazy. Stuff does happen. People are sick in the head. But people take advantage of that, and then they mix that with destroying black careers and destroying black excellence.\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 they broke all types of people. Charlie Sheen was strung out on all types of stuff. Shia Labeouf. But Michael Jackson was so talented, hardworking. He changed the world with his music. Literally. Once, when I was performing, I looked out in the crowd and there was this couple crying tears of joy. Michael Jackson used to have a whole crowd doing that.\u201dJackson denied any wrongdoing before he died in 2009, and his nephew Taj recently\u00a0confirmed to NME that he was working on a counter-documentary to dispute the claims made in Leaving Neverland.Meanwhile,\u00a0Juice WRLD\u2018s second album \u2018Death Race for Love\u2019 recently topped the Billboard 200 in the first week of its release.The rapper\u2019s first number one album, it sold a total of 165,000 copies in the first week, including 120,000 streaming equivalent albums (SEAs).", "pptitle": ["juic", "wrld", "alleg", "michael", "jackson", "leav", "neverland", "career", "stuff"]}
