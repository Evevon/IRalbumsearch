The Texan rapper and singer has previously released two solo albums \u2013 2014\u2019s \u2018MTV1987\u2019 and 2016\u2019s \u2018American Boyfriend: A Suburban Love Story\u2019. Abstract shared the short video clip on his Twitter page earlier today (March 27). The sentences \u201cTeach me empathy\u201d, \u201cTeach me how to feel\u201d, and \u201cARIZONA baby\u201d are shown in between shots of someone jumping off the roof of a house into a swimming pool, Abstract taking off his shirt, flexing his bicep, and sitting in the back of a car. You can watch it below now.It is currently unclear what the video is for. Last week (March 20), the rapper posted an image on his Twitter page that looked like an album cover. The photo had a Parental Advisory \u2013 Explicit Content sticker in the bottom right corner, prompting speculation that the star is preparing to release a new solo record.Meanwhile, last month Brockhampton were nominated for Best International Group at the 2019 BRIT Awards. Speaking to NME on the red carpet, they refused to say much about their next album but said it was \u201cnot going to be what anyone expects.\u201d Last year, Abstract spoke about how he wanted to be considered an icon, rather than a queer icon. \u201cIn order to make a change, I have to exist in a traditionally homophobic space such as hip-hop,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I were to just be this queer rapper, who only spoke to queer kids\u2026 I don\u2019t think I could as effectively make a change for another young, black queer kid growing up in Texas.\u201d", "pptitle": ["watch", "brockhampton", "kevin", "abstract", "trailer", "new", "project"]}
