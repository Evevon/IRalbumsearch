Tickets for the gig will go on sale on Friday (March 29) from here.While\u00a0Barry said that Avail currently have no further plans to tour or record new music, the vocalist told Noisey\u00a0about what it was like for the band to recently play together for the first time in a number of years.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know if we could play music anymore,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe band, minus me and Beau, got together and practised a few times and didn\u2019t want everyone to come in and stand there with their arms crossed, staring at middle-aged men trying to remember songs they haven\u2019t played in 12 or 13 years.\u201cSo Erik [Larson] called me and said, \u2018Come on in whenever you\u2019re ready.\u2019 So I went to Iron Reagan\u2019s practice spot with no rehearsal \u2013 I didn\u2019t warm up, I didn\u2019t review the songs, I didn\u2019t know which songs they were gonna play \u2013 and I plugged in my microphone. There was not even much talking. They just started. It was a fucking whirlwind. They sounded fucking fantastic. I don\u2019t know how a brain can retain so many stupid fucking lyrics, but I was able to make it through all of the songs, pretty much.\u201d", "pptitle": ["avail", "announc", "reunion", "celebr", "jame", "anniversari"]}
