He\u2019s also planning to release and tour his debut solo album \u2018Sun Songs\u2019, which is due out in the summer.The singer/songwriter has now publicly announced his MS diagnosis. In a letter to fans which was posted on Everclear\u2019s website, he revealed that he was first diagnosed shortly after he was involved in a car accident three years ago. Believing that he had a pinched nerve in his neck as a result of the crash, Alexakis underwent a number of tests in hospital before a\u00a0neurologist \u201ctold me that I have a form of Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), and that I have had it for anywhere between 10 to 20 years\u201d.\u201cThe words Multiple Sclerosis conjure up all sorts of images: helplessness, wheel chairs, pain, misery, and worst of all, hopelessness \u2013 and pity in the eyes of my family and friends (you get the picture),\u201d Alexakis wrote. \u201cI remember later that night my wife Vanessa holding my face in her hands, and telling me \u2018we got this\u2019, with not a shred of pity or fear in her eyes. I knew then that I wasn\u2019t going to go through this alone. My wife is a lot of things \u2013 all good, but one thing she isn\u2019t is fake, something we have in common. We don\u2019t do fake in our family. My wife is a bad ass, and she reminded me in that moment, that so am I.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been almost three years since that diagnosis, and MS has become another part of my life,\u201d he continued. \u201cI have done amazing things in that time \u2013 touring four full tours with Everclear, in addition to another 250 plus shows all around the world, and I\u2019m still going strong. I have spent precious time with my family and friends; we bought a house that we love last year, and I have learned what the word gratitude really means.\u201cAll that said, I can feel the disease slowly growing in me. I now have to give myself injections three times a week. My neurologist says as long as I stay on the medication, I should live into my 80\u2019s without progression. We shall see.\u201dAlexakis also said that he wanted to make his diagnosis public because he\u2019d been hearing \u201ca lot of people say that I am drinking again or back on drugs because they have seen me look unsteady on stage or around town (people say all sorts of nasty things when they don\u2019t think you can hear them)\u201d.\u201cTo be honest, I have never cared about what people say about me personally \u2013 except, that is, for the people that I care about (ie..YOU) and what they think,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted you to know the truth, simple as that.\u201cSo, if you see me stumbling\u2026 sweaty, looking both tired and anxious at the same time, maybe a little more confused than usual, or forgetting lyrics yet looking happy (which is weird for me), please know that I have not fallen off the wagon. I am just learning how to be the new me. \u201cEverclear\u2019s last album, \u2018Black Is The New Black\u2019, was released in 2015.", "pptitle": ["everclear", "frontman", "art", "alexaki", "reveal", "multipl", "sclerosi", "diagnosi"]}
