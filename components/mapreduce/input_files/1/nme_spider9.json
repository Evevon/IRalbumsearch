I\u2019m never gonna live that one down! One Direction.\u201dShe continued: \u201cHe could have gone one or two ways: he could have made a serious pop record, which would have been less of a risk, or he could have made a rock and roll record and take a risk, and he did.\u201dEarlier in the evening, Nicks performed on stage at the ceremony with Styles and Don Henley. You can see some images and videos from the performance here:Becoming the only female to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame twice, first as a member of Fleetwood Mac and now as a solo artist, Nicks performed \u2018Stand Back\u2019, \u2018Leather and Lace\u2019, \u2018Stop Dragging My Heart Around\u2019 and \u2018Edge of Seventeen.\u2019 She also paid tribute to Prince\u00a0with her final song, interspersing it with lyrics from \u2018When Doves Cry.\u2019In his speech to the star ahead of the award, Styles said:\u00a0\u201cStevie Nicks is the first female artist to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame a second time. First, with Fleetwood Mac, and now for her unforgettable solo work. With Stevie, you\u2019re not celebrating music from long ago through the mists of time. She was standing on stage headlining a place doing her best work just three nights ago. She is forever current. She is forever Stevie.\u201c\u2026She is the magical gypsy godmother who occupies the in-between. It\u2019s a space that can and will only ever be hers. She\u2019s a lot like a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll Nina Simone \u2014 finding the notes that only she can. And by being so unapologetically herself, she gives others permission to do the same. That is true Stevie.\u201dLast year, Nicks reacted to news that she would become the first woman to be inducted into Rock & Roll Hall of Fame twice.Writing about the news on Twitter, Nicks said: \u201cI have a lot to say about this\u2026For now I will just say, I have been in a band since 1968. To be recognized for my solo work makes me take a deep breath and smile. It\u2019s a glorious feeling.\u201d", "pptitle": ["im", "gonna", "live", "stevi", "nick", "thought", "harri", "style", "use", "nsync"]}
