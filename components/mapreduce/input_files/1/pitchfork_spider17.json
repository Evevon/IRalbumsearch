His towering, synth-infused rock anthems and solemn guitar-and-voice meditations relay his experience in plain language: his adolescence in the small Indiana town of Goshen, his musical heroes, his fears and self-loathing, the messy emotional goulash of love and marriage. His rocker\u2019s distillation of Henry James\u2019 position\u2014that \u201cA novel is in its broadest definition a personal, a direct impression of life\u201d\u2014fuses a bold shoegaze and heartland-rock aesthetic with the lyrical posture of modern confessionalists like Mount Eerie and Margo Price. The contrast reflects the dimensions of Showalter, alternately a contemplative and reclusive figure steeped in the craft and an unrepentant showman who can command a room with comedic bits and tales of late-night ragers.\nNew album Eraserland finds him at his breaking point. It was written in a cloud of depression and self-doubt, following years of touring on the success of breakthrough record HEAL, and the acknowledgment that its follow-up, Hard Love, didn\u2019t quite land with fans the same way. By winter of 2017, feeling depleted, Showalter took a sabbatical to\u2014of all places\u2014the Jersey Shore. Alone, he walked the beaches and meditated on his favorite albums. Listening to Talk Talk\u2019s Spirit of Eden, he\u2019s said, almost literally saved his life.\nAt the height of Showalter\u2019s existential crisis, My Morning Jacket guitarist Carl Broemel rallied bandmates Bo Koster (keyboards), Patrick Hallahan (drums), and Tom Blankenship (bass) to back Showalter on a new suite of songs, a vote of confidence that proved to be a potent motivator. Eraserland soars in both its booming and hushed moments, a testament to the skills of this lockstep outfit. These seasoned players navigate Showalter\u2019s emotional cosmos with equal parts professionalism and empathy. Country star Jason Isbell lends his understated shredding, while singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Emma Ruth Rundle adds elegant background vocals. Together they bring an easygoing quality to what could have been an overwrought extension of emotional turmoil.\nInstead, Eraserland\u2019s lyrical constellations shine in plain, profound confessions. \u201cI don\u2019t feel it anymore,\u201d the first line of opener \u201cWeird Ways,\u201d is less a slacker\u2019s excuse than a stinging admission of defeat. The song portends Eraserland\u2019s emotional arc: Anguish and despondence cues philosophical probing and rebirth, relayed through stories about family, friends, idols, and dreams. Such disclosure leaves little room for interpretation and, in less capable hands, might feel naive. Here, each sentiment radiates through Showalter\u2019s fibrous voice and road-worn phrasing. By the end, he\u2019s found some light. \u201cIf you believe you can be loved, you'll outlive your past,\u201d he promises on \u201cForever Chords,\u201d the album\u2019s conclusion.\nAll this unfolds in sober meditations and electrified anthems where synths fuse with glistening electric guitar and ringing cymbals. Showalter\u2019s preference for blending the celestial touchstones of British post-punk with the sinewy qualities of his American heroes has never been better executed than it is here: \u201cFinal Fires\u201d melds the synth and guitar tones of the Cure with the upcountry jangle of Tom Petty, while the title track swirls in a haze of My Bloody Valentine\u2019s crescendos and Joy Division's negative space. \u201cMoon Landing\u201d references the vibey narration and guitar jam of Endless Boogie. Somehow this totem of influences works, stacked one atop another in a monument to the newly refocused Strand of Oaks.\n", "pptitle": ["eraserland"]}
