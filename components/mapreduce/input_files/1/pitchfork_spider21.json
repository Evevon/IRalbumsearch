The singer and producer\u2019s works are labyrinths of genre and style that teem with trapdoors. Her voice, a lithe contralto dusted with a warm rasp, gives her songs a sensual quality, but she\u2019s more trickster than romantic. \u201cJungle Exit,\u201d from her debut EP, was written in Spanish, translated to English, then sung in Swahili. That cheeky elusiveness can make her music seem playful, but a wearying pall hangs over her debut album Ancestor Boy. Built from globally sourced strains of pop, ambient, and industrial, the record is rich in resources and poor in spirit.\nReleased on Lafawndah\u2019s Concordia imprint, Ancestor Boy is intended as a blueprint for wayward artists. \u201cThe idea is to create a home for all the orphans of the world,\u201d she has said. \u201cAll the artists that don\u2019t sit properly, that are doing things that are challenging, that are not obeying enough of what\u2019s expected of them.\u201d That\u2019s a worthwhile goal, but Lafawndah is no Professor X. Hell, she\u2019s no Emma Frost, either. Lafawndah has no discernible vision or aesthetic: She shrouds songs in signifiers and lets entropy take the wheel.\n\u201cUniform,\u201d the album\u2019s opening track, is a vague statement of iconoclasm. \u201cI would never know, I would never know/Which color, which color/The one they wanna see me in.\u201d She pens narratives within contexts that only she knows, making her storytelling cryptic at best, and gibberish at worst. The title track is so vague and ponderous it could be a church marquee. \u201cDid he come from the water?/Did he come from the sky?/Did he come from the mountains?\u201d she asks. She could be talking about Jesus or Columbus or Optimus Prime. It\u2019s hard to care.\nThis abstraction wouldn\u2019t be as frustrating if the mood weren\u2019t so grave and self-serious. The production, a polished blend of quaking bass, militant percussion, and blaring drones, is made to shock and awe. It rarely does. Lafawndah\u2019s voice is consistently prominent, leading the compositions along and tempering their volatility. On \u201cSubstancia\u201d sirens and warped horns swell to a peak then drop away so Lafawndah can offer toothless threats. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell I got you encircled?\u201d she asks. The synths on \u201cJoseph\u201d quiver with tension, but only pantomime danger. Lafawndah sings of some perilous journey, but the song itself feels about as harrowing as working from home.\nThe album\u2019s one blip of color is \u201cTourist,\u201d a lite-dancehall track that takes a jab at exoticism. Lafawndah convincingly embodies the latent colonialism that can underlie tourism. Speaking in first-person, her tourist makes casual observations that reek of unearned intimacy. \u201cI like how you dress and how you braid your hair,\u201d she coos with a treacly smugness. The song ultimately feels like a catfish though. Not only is the trop-house she's mocking low-hanging fruit, but throughout Ancestor Boy, it's never clear where precisely she's coming from, literally or artistically. Her perspective is blandly adrift, tethered to neither a point of origin nor a destination. \u201cI am an island,\u201d she declares on \u201cBlueprint,\u201d attempting to find pride in her singularity. Big mood, little substance.\n", "pptitle": ["ancestor", "boy"]}
