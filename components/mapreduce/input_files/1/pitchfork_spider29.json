But where Archy Marshall swerved towards solitary murkiness, Yanya, on her debut album, has shocked her desolate confrontations into some of the most adventurous pop-rock crucibles since Mitski\u2019s Puberty 2. They are catalysts for communal outpouring that spark with adrenaline and anxiety, a mixture of the raw and the refined, her guitar fuzz mingling with tinselly synth glitter and the bluesy disaffection of her startling voice.\nBetween some songs, you hear Yanya playing the part of a telephone operator for a wellness hotline she has called WWAY Health, the concept of which, across five satirical skits, eventually fizzles out. They\u2019re quite funny the first time, but they break up what is otherwise a fantastically sequenced and always essential album. They undersell it a bit, too: Yanya\u2019s lyrics on Miss Universe aren\u2019t so much about looking to external forces for easy affirmation as they are figuring out the kind of intensity and hunger that she can allow herself to feel as a young woman: \u201cGot to learn/Got to realize what this means/Got to earn/Got to decide who to please,\u201d she sings on \u201cAngels,\u201d her waltzing guitar gaining intensity before the pressure gauge blows.\nYanya writes gorgeously about the seduction of sensation, no matter its side effects: \u201cDeep underwater I breathe/Let me soak/Chasing the shades of the love that we made, of the love that we broke,\u201d she sings on \u201cBaby Blu,\u201d a cloudy meditation that builds into subtly euphoric gospel house. On \u201cTears,\u201d if someone doesn\u2019t hold her back, she\u2019ll be \u201clying in a pool of someone else\u2019s blood.\u201d She\u2019s \u201cgetting high just from the heat\u201d in \u201cHeat Rises,\u201d singing in snatched, gasped phrases over a fizzing drum machine, the effect as decadent yet panic-ridden as an anxiety attack in a sauna. Her songwriting is a textural palace of wonders.\nWhere Yanya\u2019s lyrics portray her as someone prone to wallowing in forbidden emotions, her arrangements are more circumspect, toying impeccably with resistance and release. \u201cIn Your Head\u201d lurches between gimlet-eyed composure and cataclysmic panic. She never uses climaxes as a musical surrogate for emotion. A few tracks towards the end echo the spaciousness of Yanya\u2019s early material and shape the album\u2019s enveloping dynamic as a whole. Others, like \u201cSafety Net,\u201d exude a simmering sadness built from nimble drum machines and seamless pop melody, or, like \u201cParadise,\u201d buoy Yanya\u2019s worries with easygoing saxophone motifs courtesy of her improbably named sidekick, Jazzi Bobbi.\nNothing controls the mood of Miss Universe like Yanya herself. She is adept with both a wounded lament and a desperate falsetto. Sometimes she whips between the two with exhilarating yelps, as if someone yanked a ripcord inside her lungs. In powerful moments, her voice is full of hunger; in desperate moments, that hunger empties out. \u201cI\u2019m still wired to want these things,\u201d Yanya sings sullenly on the last song, the relatively unadorned \u201cHeavyweight Champion of the Year,\u201d slashing out choppy chords that tease one final cathartic payoff. Yanya\u2019s songs reflect a woman who\u2019s uncertain of how much of herself to reveal to the world. That is both the allure of Miss Universe and what augurs even brighter things to come.\n", "pptitle": ["miss", "univers"]}
