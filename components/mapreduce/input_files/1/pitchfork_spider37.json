The two of them have become serial collaborators, and they have done so many different things that it is near-impossible to accurately predict what they might sound like together.\nOn their new record Lux Prima, they appear to revel in the possibility of a blank slate. O said of making Lux Prima that \u201cwhen you create from a blurry place you can go places further than you\u2019ve ever been,\u201d while Danger Mouse talked of \u201clooking for a place rather than a sound.\u201d Listening to the results, I imagine that place to be Paris 1969, Detroit 1964 or Bristol 1995, a blend of Serge Gainsbourg\u2019s orchestral grace, Motown pop hustle, and the packed and dusty sound of \u201890s trip hop.\nAt times, the results are sublime. \u201cLux Prima,\u201d the opening track, arrives on a swell of drums and synth harmonies then glides out on a wash of beatific chord changes. \u201cRedeemer\u201d carries the theatrical tang of spaghetti Westerns, and \u201cNox Lumina\u201d closes the album in the fug of soured summer of love vibes. The album\u2019s sound is sparse, allowing the listener to savor the interaction between elements.\nIt helps that Karen O is in immaculate voice throughout. Album highlight \u201cWoman\u201d features one of her greatest vocals, an astounding mixture of power, control, and agility that reads like a forceful fuck-you to anyone who has ever tried to mess with her. At other times her vocals are variously dramatic (\u201cMinistry\u201d), aquatic (\u201cDrown\u201d), and melancholic (\u201cNox Lumina\u201d), in what must be one of the most versatile vocal performances to grace a recent pop album.\nLux Prima sounds so lush, in fact, that at times you wish that O and the Mouse had worried less about conventional song structure. The album\u2019s weak spots are its choruses which\u2014\u201cTurn the Light\u201d and \u201cWoman\u201d aside\u2014feel tacked on, as if our heroes suddenly remembered that songs conventionally need choruses and acted accordingly. Karen O can write a killer hook\u2014Yeah Yeah Yeahs\u2019 \u201cZero\u201d and \u201cMaps\u201d proved that a long time ago\u2014but the lackluster hooks on \u201cLux Prima,\u201d \u201cMinistry,\u201d and \u201cDrown\u201d sit like a poorly-drawn mustache on an otherwise-immaculate portrait.\nAccordingly, Lux Prima works better as a journey than a destination. It never sounds better than when going nowhere fast, its charmingly anachronistic sound at odds with the sharply engineered hustle of the modern pop world. Karen O and Danger Mouse have dreamt up a vividly imagined world, and it\u2019s a pleasure to get lost in it. With a little more freedom, it could have been divine.\n", "pptitle": ["lux", "prima"]}
