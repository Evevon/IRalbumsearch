It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the audacity of it all and marvel at how formal limitations can lead to such emotional work. The knowledge that, say, a deeply moving piece of drone music was sourced from the sound of a bow drawn across the wires of a rat\u2019s cage\u2014empty, because the rat had recently died\u2014has several layers of poignancy. You can enjoy the shriek as sound, enjoy it as concept, enjoy it for the pictures the contextual information, like its title \u201cFor Felix (And All the Rats),\u201d puts into your head. And on top of that, Matmos make you hear\u2014really hear\u2014the materials used for their music\u2019s creation. Beyond how they are transformed into music, there is a sense that objects and ideas have sonic properties as distinctive as fingerprints.\u00a0\nFor their new album,\u00a0Plastic Anniversary, Matmos tackle the ubiquitous material named in the title.\u00a0We already know that plastic has a sound. On the one hand, \u201cplastic\u201d means \u201cfake,\u201d and music described as such is thought to be cheap, artificial. And yet creative uses of plastic are everywhere. The sound of plastic makes me think of a familiar sound of the city\u2014kids on the street who play drums on buckets. I think of Ornette Coleman, who played a plastic saxophone throughout his rise in the 1950s and \u201960s, at first because it was more affordable, and later because he came to prefer its harsher tone, which he felt made it sound closer to the human voice.\u00a0Plastic leaves space for ingenuity, because it\u2019s constantly being repurposed, and it\u2019s constantly being repurposed because it never goes away. Plastic objects will retain their structural integrity long after our bodies have withered into dust.\nSo the material is a natural fit for a Matmos album, and Plastic Anniversary makes you realize that the sound of plastic is wider than you might have imagined. It is bouncy, percussion-heavy, and tuneful, with the group\u2019s playful rhythmic sense in the foreground. On \u201cFanfare for Polyethylene Waste Containers,\u201d they enlisted the drumline from Montana\u2019s Whitefish High School Marching Band for a rolling beat on garbage cans, while a cast of musicians plays an ominous descending theme on plastic horns. The album\u2019s gorgeous title track also includes plastic wind instruments but goes from a bittersweet lament to a rollicking overture. These tracks hint at orchestral music, while \u201cSilicone Gel Implant\u201d and \u201cExtending the Plastisphere to GJ237b\u201d both have elements of early electro, with percolating sequencers and squelchy lead melodies.\nWith the help of Catalonia Institute of Space Studies, a version of the latter track was beamed from a high-power radio tower in the direction of the named star system. The liner notes spelling out the how and why of Plastic Anniversary show gestures that range from simply playful (the sounds on \u201cBreaking Bread\u201d were recorded as the group destroyed records made by the easy listening group of the same name) to the pointed (\u201cThermoplastic Riot Shield\u201d was sourced from recordings of a device used by the Albuquerque Police Department, and includes links to information about how to make riot shields inoperable), and as the sounds and references pile up the album becomes a mass of possibilities, each pointing toward ideas to explore in more detail later.\nThere\u2019s always a risk that an album like this one will be received as novelty music, but the compositional integrity is there, and the music is engaging purely on the level of sound. But Plastic Anniversary\u2019s ultimate resonance comes when you take in everything\u2014ideas, sounds, images, links. On the album\u2019s back cover is a heartbreaking photograph of a sea bird decaying on a beach, its body almost gone while the plastic material that had been in its stomach\u2014and presumably had caused its death\u2014remains. The colors are sickeningly beautiful, like this album at its best.\n", "pptitle": ["plastic", "anniversari"]}
