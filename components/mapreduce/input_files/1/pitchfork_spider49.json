On 2014\u2019s Doom Abuse, the Omaha electro-rock outfit sounded more than ever like a band in search of a machine to rage against, settling instead on a succession of ever-sillier anti-tech, anti-conformity, anti-everything screeds that it\u2019s hard to imagine even they took very seriously. Substance has always been secondary to style for these guys, but it\u2019s still no fun listening to a band that doesn\u2019t buy their own sloganeering.\nIf the Faint are still smirking on Egowerk, their first album in five years, then they\u2019re doing a better job disguising it. They\u2019ve focused their ire on a subject a good deal more topical and resonant: social media, specifically the ways online platforms play into society\u2019s worst instincts and exacerbate cultural divides. Singer Todd Fink doesn\u2019t need to overstate the fallout, because we\u2019re all living it. Especially in the wake of 2016, we\u2019ve seen how people willingly spread misinformation, bully each other into eating disorders or worse, and viciously attack anybody perceived as the opposition. \u201cChameleon Nights\u201d details the entrenchment: \u201cEverybody\u2019s talking but we don\u2019t know shit/You fight, I fight, it\u2019s an ego trip/It\u2019s a video game and you\u2019re an avatar/What you fake becomes what you are.\u201d\nThe damage isn\u2019t only confined to the comment sections. There\u2019s also the gradual erosion of your self-esteem that comes from spending so much time in an artificial environment where everyone you know is trying their best to make their lives look better than yours. \u201cLife\u2019s a Joke\u201d captures the fruitlessness of seeking validation online. \u201cYou want to fit in/But you want to stand out,\u201d Fink sings over grinding, distressed synths. \u201cYou want to trust your body/But you\u2019re best without.\u201d\nAs usual, the music is fitfully vicious. Opener \u201cChild Asleep\u201d may be the Faint\u2019s most colossal track yet, a gnarly frenzy of rumbling 808s and electric jolts. Self-producing has served the band well; the drums have the uncanny synthetic clap of techno, yet they sound like they\u2019re reverberating off of real walls. It won\u2019t surprise anybody who\u2019s caught their live show that the group is still in fighting shape. Long after casual listeners misplaced their copies of the Saddle Creek 50, the Faint continued drawing surprisingly large, passionate crowds, and some of those stage reflexes carry over to Egowerk\u2019s dramatic halts and breakdowns. Even as the group has graduated beyond the reedy electronics of their early \u201900s dance-punk and immersed themselves more fully in EDM, the music has retained its urgent physicality.\nStill, it\u2019s probably for the best that the Faint continue working at their recent leisurely pace of about an album every half decade, because this band burns through their ideas fast. Toward the end of Egowerk the songs grow thinner and more obvious in their \u201980s references. Gary Numan synths flutter over the four-on-the-floor electro-funk of \u201cYoung & Realistic,\u201d the album\u2019s most faithful callback of the Danse Macabre days, while \u201cAutomaton\u201d robot dances the record to the finish line with no particular ambition to awe. A little bit of the Faint goes a long way, but as long as there\u2019s technological angst\u2014and it\u2019s impossible to imagine a time when there won\u2019t be\u2014there\u2019s always going to some life left in this sound.\n", "pptitle": ["egowerk"]}
