Her pictures are small moments, dramatically lit \u2014\u00a0a girl staring at a grand piano; a faceless woman searching for a book on her knees. To Chua, photography could only hope to convey a piece of a wider story, a small fraction of an emotion: \u201call it can show is a fragment of a narrative,\u201d she said. Antidotes 1, her debut solo EP, radiates with the same kind of heightened interiority, swapping stage lighting for the complex rhythms of her cello.\nAs the vocalist of Felix, Chua had a kind of manic flow, urgent and hushed, like someone spilling secrets to a friend in the middle of homeroom. But from the first notes of Antidotes 1, Chua is altogether richer, closer, more patient. A classically trained cellist, Chua adeptly molds her vocals around her textured, drawn-out bow strokes. She wades carefully into opener \u201cFeel Something,\u201d taking stock of her surroundings, like a morning stretch: \u201cHow high, how far, how deep,\u201d she sings, her voice velvety like a weighted blanket.\nThere is a tactile quality to Chua\u2019s singing, an intimacy that incites goosebumps. She can take the word \u201csomething\u201d in the opener\u2019s refrain, \u201cI just wanna feel something,\u201d and chop it up, shortening the first half and dragging out \u201cthing\u201d until it reveals the crevices of her breath. In another world, her low, soothing croon could place her next to neo-R&B singers like Milosh, but there is a distinctive rawness to her singing. Parts of \u201cFeel Something\u201d originally appear in a composition called \u201cMusic For One,\u201d and the record indeed seems designed for solo consumption: \u201cIt\u2019s music for you, in your bubble, with your headphones,\u201d she said of \u201cMusic For One\u201d in 2013.\nChua takes a circuitous approach to writing. There is nothing that could be called a \u201cchorus\u201d here; she instead prefers to repeat long verses until they become hypnotic. Like her photographs, her lyrics are cryptic, dropping into the middle of a fable: \u201cYou better have bore a son,\u201d she sings ominously on \u201cWhatever It Takes,\u201d before launching into a dark refrain about \u201cwitches in exile.\u201d Chua has a way of sounding remarkably human even in the depths of a fairytale narrative: \u201cThe demons I carry are fake,\u201d she sings, the pain palpable as her voice breaks on the last word.\nAntidotes 1 is a lesson in patience\u2014Chua\u00a0holds a note for an entire breath, until she buckles and runs out of air, and drags the cello through one note until it seems to naturally fade into the next, as on \u201cSemitones.\u201d In music, a semitone is the smallest interval between two notes. Chua makes these steps, first on the guitar and then echoed on the cello, in slow, languorous movements. As if in conversation with the instrument, she fills the space in between notes with her voice, raised barely above a lilting whisper. When she harmonizes on \u201cSomebody Who,\u201d it is with an alien, distorted recording of her singing, sharpened slightly. \u201cThe earth is dying,\u201d she repeats plainly, as her vocal accompaniment begins to break down. The cello descends a dissonant scale, glassy and full, until it seems to fade into memory.\n", "pptitle": ["antidot", "1", "ep"]}
