The Arkansas native\u2019s popularity grew immensely back in 2014 when she released the girl-bossy single \u201cNo Small Talk\u201d; the song even made its way to the soundtrack for Issa Rae\u2019s hit television series \u201cInsecure\u201d after being remixed by Childish Gambino. But a year after the release of her PRIMARY EP, the rapper and singer takes a more intimate approach. For Kari, CRY 4 HELP is about confronting trauma and healing, rather than an outlet for upbeat, braggadocious anthems.\nThe EP\u2019s lead single, \u201cLeave Me Alone,\u201d explores Kari\u2019s lust for isolation coupled with a disdain for people who simply want to waste her time. Over production that draws inspiration from 1970\u2019s soul, she shows us a new side of herself. While \u201cNo Small Talk\u201d was a bold declaration of confidence filled with cell-phone chirps and 808s, Kari now uses live drums and hazy synths working together to carry her alto croons. \u201cThinking \u2018Damn man, where are my friends?\u2019 I guess that love is just for pretend,\u201d she resounds. Though she yearns to be alone, the need for simple human companionship is equally as present.\nKari remains just as unguarded on \u201cMedicated,\u201d a woozy song built on a slow, heavy drumbeat. The song\u2019s hook spells out her intense highs and emotional lows\u2014\u201cHere we go again/She\u2019s rollercoasterin,\u201d she sings. Her voice lags behind the beat, giving a playful wink to the opening line, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be medicated.\u201d She quickly follows up in the second verse with the idea that drinking away the pain may be much more her speed, though it doesn\u2019t help with sustaining the life she\u2019s trying to lead.\nOn \u201cLatch Key,\u201d the EP\u2019s closing song, Kari cuts to the chase. No longer crooning, she reverts to vivid storytelling in a monotonous yet resentful voice\u2014separating this record from the other songful numbers. \u201cAll the while, I\u2019m poppin\u2019 thyroid pills to balance out my levels/Preparin\u2019 for motherhood, Lord knew I wasn\u2019t ready/About two weeks later, the baby had miscarried.\u201d As Kari unpacks her load of emotional turmoil, she gives listeners a chilling look into her trauma and delivers it with unflinching attention to detail.\nWith each song peeling back another layer of her pain, Kari strongly suggests that the internal wounds you don\u2019t deal with are the ones that will continue to haunt you. But therein lies this dark, moody EP\u2019s silver lining. CRY 4 HELP is not only a wake-up call to go ahead and face the hurtful things in your life that you may believe you can\u2019t, but also a reflection of Kari\u2019s extensive growth as an artist and as a woman who has experienced life\u2019s many challenges.\n", "pptitle": ["4", "help", "ep"]}
