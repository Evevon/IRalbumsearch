"date_published": ["2019-03-17T05:00:00"], "sentiment": 0.17861471861471864, "content": "Back in 1997, Eve\u2019s promising career was almost derailed by a snarky, pill-popping, bleach-blond white boy from Detroit. She\u2019d started messing around with music as a teen, but only began pursuing it in good faith after a chance encounter with Mase at the Bronx strip club where she briefly sojourned. \u201cThat night, he drove me around and we rapped all night until the sun came up,\u201d she recalled recently. \u201cAnd I never went back in the club.\u201d After another fortuitous meeting, this one with an executive at Dr. Dre\u2019s Aftermath records, Eve delivered an audition, flew to Los Angeles, and was signed pretty much on the spot. Eight months into the collaboration, Dre met Eminem, and Eve was sent packing to Philly.\nBut as with all the best origin stories, that failure gave Eve Jihan Jeffers resolve. An opportunity presented itself in the form of Ruff Ryders, a New York crew which, in the late \u201990s, had made the transition from management company to label. Eve stood out with her platinum-blonde baldie and a pair of selectively-deployed paw prints on her chest. Her rap skills would soon become just as striking. \u201cThey made me write and recite, write and recite,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like boot camp. You had to prove yourself to them, and that\u2019s what made me a better MC.\u201d\nIn 1998, the same year Ruff Ryders\u2019 principal rapper DMX released two platinum-selling albums, Eve got to work. By that point, the only credit to her name was a loosie on the Bulworth soundtrack, released as Eve of Destruction. But in 1999, she appeared (although uncredited) alongside Erykah Badu on the Roots\u2019 breakout \u201cYou Got Me\u201d and joined Blackstreet, Janet Jackson, and Ja Rule on the pastel \u201cGirlfriend/Boyfriend.\u201d She employed a different style on all of them: sly, seductive incense-rap here, no-nonsense wit there. Eve\u2019s first proper release, the vaguely salsa-inspired \u201cWhat Ya Want,\u201d featuring Nokio of Dru Hill, was built around a rudimentary Latin preset on an E-MU synth, but it soon cracked the Top 40.\nThat fall, amid Y2K mania and vague collective fears about an uncertain future, Eve officially claimed her spot as Ruff Ryders\u2019 self-described \u201cpitbull in a skirt\u201d and released Let There Be Eve\u2026Ruff Ryders\u2019 First Lady. It became the third rap album by a woman to crest the Billboard 200. She was 21, one of a handful of women who served in the token but compulsory role as the \u201cfirst lady\u201d of any given ascendant rap crew. Lil\u2019 Kim, Foxy Brown, Mia X, and Rah Digga, among others who had achieved name recognition within the genre, all had their own styles. And of course there was Lauryn Hill, who had managed to escape the tyranny of Wyclef and the Fugees to release an album that set records still standing today.\nLike Eve, many of these women were more charismatic and skilled than their male counterparts, but often had less creative control of their own projects. You can hear that tension all over Let There Be Eve; across its 14 songs and four skits, the domineering energy of Ruff Ryders is palpable and weaselly. Eve isn\u2019t even the first voice you hear on her own debut album, or the second, or third. The intro track, \u201cFirst Lady,\u201d is the equivalent of a red carpet being unfurled, a call-and-response chant delivered by Swizz Beatz and an anonymous male chorus: \u201cWhen I say E-VAY, y\u2019all say E/When I say RU-UFF, y\u2019all say RYDERS.\u201d The next track, the steel-tipped \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About,\u201d opens with ad-libs from Ruff Ryders\u2019 associate Drag-On. When Eve finally appears, a couple seconds in, it feels like the relief of a sunbeam.\nStill, it\u2019s very much a family affair throughout. Even when it feels like her ideas are retrofitted to preexisting, Swizz-produced morsels\u2014on the frosty posse cut \u201cScenario 2000,\u201d featuring DMX, Drag-On, and the Lox, for example, Swizz samples himself\u2014Eve establishes breathing room for herself. One track, the chest-thumping skit \u201cMy Bitches,\u201d is a direct response to DMX\u2019s \u201cMy Niggas,\u201d but is awesomely appropriated to act like something of a thesis statement for the entire project: \u201cMy bitches, my bitches that take care of they kids/My bitches, my bitches that you don\u2019t respect/My bitches, my bitches that you always neglect/Y\u2019all niggas ain\u2019t real, y\u2019all niggas ain\u2019t shit.\u201d Eve\u2019s lyrics often appear simple in transcription, but they land with the heart and urgency Philly rap is celebrated for.\nDespite the Ruff Ryders\u2019 attempts at co-opting Let There Be Eve, it winds up being an album of self-determination, where she effortlessly bests the guys at what they think is their own game. There is little experimentation on the album\u2014that would come later, with her blockbuster Scorpion album\u2014but Eve bobs and weaves with dexterity, skillfully overcoming Swizz Beatz\u2019s anemic production. At the time, collaborators and critics often attributed Eve\u2019s success to her ability to hang with the guys without sacrificing her conventional femininity; the critic Tour\u00e9, in a Rolling Stone review of the album, described her as \u201ca thug with curves.\u201d Her maneuvering required a kind of gender code-switching in which she had to be the \u201cpitbull in a skirt,\u201d years before the concept of the Cool Girl would become solidified in pop culture. It was an oppressive and offensive framework, mirrored across genres of all kinds, and Eve challenged it in part by using hardcore, \u201cmasculine\u201d rap to sculpt her own power.\nShe defined herself boldly, a feminist former stripper who loved her all-male crew but reserved a unique allegiance for her girlfriends. The album\u2019s primary singles were expressions of loyalty to both. The plucky, buoyant \u201cGotta Man,\u201d is a ride-or-die anthem, featuring bail money happily paid and secrets kept. As a teen, I cried often to \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d the semi-biographical single in which Eve recounts her best friend\u2019s abuse at the hands of a partner, and dreams up a revenge fantasy: \u201cI don\u2019t even know you and I\u2019d kill you myself/You played with her like a doll and put her back on the shelf/Wouldn\u2019t let her go to school and better herself/She had a baby by your ass and you ain\u2019t giving no help.\u201d Elsewhere in 1999, Destiny\u2019s Child and TLC were demanding accountability from men, across songs like \u201cBills, Bills, Bills\u201d and \u201cNo Scrubs,\u201d which unfairly lumped them together as man-hating feminists. Eve joined the chorus, but grounded that ethos in concrete, high-stakes realities\u2014good riddance to men who ran up your phone bill, sure, but also men who didn\u2019t take care of their children, who abused their partners, who made life materially harder for the women around them. The message stuck.\nIn 2000, Eve appeared on an episode of \u201cThe Queen Latifah Show\u201d alongside the friend in question on \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d offering personal experience as PSA. The song, whose hook features an uncharacteristically somber Faith Evans, was very far from my personal experience, but as a young woman approaching adolescence, it felt like it was within the realm of some shitty hypothetical future. In the \u201990s, women like Salt-N-Pepa and Lil\u2019 Kim forced hip-hop into something resembling hospitality to sex-positive feminism. Eve took it a step further, rapping about sex (\u201cYou make me cum, I might flood the block/Wet up ya socks\u201d) in between complex narratives that got as gritty as life is. She was a welcome counterbalance to the glossy fantasies at the top of the charts, like watching a hard-hitting documentary after time spent bingeing Disney fairytales.\nBut after the album\u2019s release, Eve fell into what she describes as a depression. She found herself submerged by the sudden, swift change in her professional life, and how it warped her every day. \u201cI was 21,\u201d she told Ebony in 2001, \u201cand there was nobody who I felt like I could really talk to, who really understood what I was going through. I was going through a growth process, definitely changing from a young woman to a woman.\u201d\nShe emerged from it by plucking some creative control from Ruff Ryders and making Scorpion, a more pop-minded album that featured \u201cLet Me Blow Ya Mind,\u201d the inaugural winner of the Grammys Best Rap/Sung Collaboration category; she had traded in Drag-On and Swizz Beatz for Gwen Stefani and Dr. Dre. In doing that, she expanded the territory claimed by women rappers. Her peers, like Lil\u2019 Kim and Foxy Brown, were finding desirability as It Girls in fashion, but Eve had her ambitions set higher than appearing in advertisements for luxury brands. \u201cSome of y\u2019all ain\u2019t writing well, too concerned with fashion,\u201d she rapped, a little smugly. And yet she soon launched her own clothing line, the beloved but short-lived Fetish by Eve. All the while, she had prophesied an early retirement for herself, telling a reporter she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d keep making music after 25. She wanted to act or direct or get into philanthropy. In the 18 years since Scorpion, appeared in a handful of big-budget studio films but released just two albums. She kept her promise.\n", "pptitle": ["let", "everuff", "ryder", "ladi"]}
