They emerged on a wave of hype from the British press with a Dave Sitek-produced debut on Sub Pop, a transatlantic \u201chipster band\u201d when that still meant something.\nTwo years later, they were an imperial rock act that won the NME Best Track Award with a nearly seven-minute single as windswept and majestic as its title (\u201cSpanish Sahara\u201d). On their subsequent two albums, Foals became the rare UK act that managed to break America through perseverance and industry muscle: \u201cMy Number\u201d and \u201cMountain at My Gates\u201d made them inconceivable neighbors with Imagine Dragons on KROQ and Cage the Elephant and Silversun Pickups on a \u201cSpring Fling Rock AF\u201d package tour. This lane is all theirs if they want it, but Foals probably had greater ambitions than being the last of the Big Sentimental Boys of Britannia. They have every right to get indulgent with a double album at a point where big bands have to matter. But the \u201cPart 1\u201d appellation to Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost is deflating as it is foretelling\u2014Foals are half-stepping all over this thing.\nDropping the whole project its entirety might\u2019ve been the more impressive power move, but the split is sensible. All Foals albums get about 2/3rds of the way to true greatness and the most obvious explanation is that they all overstay their welcome by at least 10 minutes. Or, they\u2019re nearly identically sequenced and have an identical ratio of aerobic funk-rock to ambient lunar rovers that show off the laser-lit production values. But despite the thrown gauntlet as the first part of a double-album, Everything Not Saved doesn\u2019t ask to forget everything you knew about Foals, just to look at their discography from slightly different perspectives. The optimistic view of \u201cExits\u201d is that it presents a unified theory of Foals, where the cocksure strut of \u201cMiami\u201d or \u201cTotal Life Forever\u201d is given the same breathing room as \u201cSpanish Sahara\u201d or \u201cBlack Gold,\u201d but it just ends up wearing out its groove about halfway through.\n\u201cWhite Onions\u201d likewise melds the precision of 2008\u2019s Antidotes to the meatier Stooge-rawk of 2015\u2019s What Went Down and Yannis Philippakis\u2019 increasingly anodyne lyricism: \u201cI\u2019m in a maze, I break the cage\u201d\u2014like...which one? Their assumed interest in the textures and propulsion of electronic remix culture is somewhat evident from the flashbulb-popping synths of \u201cIn Degrees,\u201d but it\u2019s oddly sweatless. They\u2019re observers from the stage rather than bodies on the dance floor.\nFoals have always had the chops to pull off anything that interests them. The departure of bassist Walter Gervers could\u2019ve drastically hamstrung a band this reliant on rhythmic precision yet they\u2019ve never made a song as bass-driven as \u201cSyrups.\u201d What Everything Not Saved lacks is the audacity to risk the embarrassment inherent in making a double album or the panache to withstand it. Foals\u2019 rise notably happened while Arctic Monkeys were spinning their wheels and the 1975 were just warming up, two festival-headlining peers who boldly reinvented themselves last year. It\u2019s fair to assume Philippakis is looking over his shoulder based on the title of \u201cI\u2019m Done With the World (& It\u2019s Done With Me),\u201d but he lacks the charisma and presence of his peers to make a schmaltzy piano ballad transcendent, subversive or something more than it actually is.\nOr, Foals\u2019 problem is that they have the same ambitions as just about every other large-font rock band these days and thus the same pitfalls. Making apolitical art feels borderline negligent, and yet it\u2019s easier than ever to feel desensitized to the doomsaying when everything just seems to get incrementally worse. Philippakis feels the same way: \u201cTrump clogging up my computer/But I\u2019m watching all day,\u201d he yelps during \u201cOn the Luna,\u201d a line easy to miss amid Everything Not Saved\u2019s most memorable riff and lowbrow know-how that frames Foals as the thinking person\u2019s Red Hot Chili Peppers (\u201cWhen I was a kung fu kid on the lunar/I was moonin\u2019 at the Bella Luna\u201d).\nEverything Not Saved has been hyped as a kind of concept record to be footnoted in the Green New Deal: \u201cIn Degrees\u201d and \u201cExits\u201d could pass as torch songs for Mother Earth (\u201cNow the sea eats the sky/But they say that it\u2019s a lie\u201d), yet there\u2019s never any real sense of urgency to Foals\u2019 crowd-pleasing Coachella-core: It\u2019s less \u201cthe ice age is coming\u201d and more \u201cIceage is up next.\u201d And so as Philippakis sings \u201cCities burn/We don\u2019t give a damn/\u2019Cause we got all our friends right here,\u201d on the penultimate \u201cSunday,\u201d the hands-in-the-air-coda arrives right on cue, the perfunctory happy ending for a big-budget disaster flick that doesn\u2019t need a sequel but will get one anyway.\n", "pptitle": ["save", "lost", "1"]}
