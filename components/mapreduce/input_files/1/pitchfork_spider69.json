The widescreen pop of M83 has been effectively used in skate videos, Nicholas Sparks romances, Britney Spears documentaries, CW fairy-tale adaptations, and tear-puddled YA-novel adaptations; \u201cOutro,\u201d the mountain-scaling closer from the project\u2019s massive and marvelous 2011 album Hurry Up, We\u2019re Dreaming, has popped up in so many commercials and movie trailers that The Huffington Post once published an in-vain plea to cease syncs of the song entirely.\nAll this malleable retrofitting of the M83 catalog speaks to the project\u2019s core values dating back to the total blowout that was 2005\u2019s Before the Dawn Heals Us; specifically, nostalgia, the driving force behind so much popular culture over the past decade. Gonzalez may have not invented \u201980s fetishization, but just the Breakfast Club\u2019d cover art of 2008\u2019s Saturdays = Youth is more than enough evidence that he anticipated the trend\u2019s eventual cultural dominance years before Drive and \u201cStranger Things\u201d became mass-cultural totems.\nGonzalez\u2019s creative mind seems specifically attuned to the crafting of sounds that conjure distinct imagery\u2014which is why it\u2019s surprising that his official score work to this point hasn\u2019t packed the same effectiveness. He did double-duty in 2013 with music provided for the sci-fi action film Oblivion and his brother Yann\u2019s You and the Night; the former barely bore his imprint amid co-writer Joseph Trapanese\u2019s orchestral blare, while the latter resembled variations on Hurry Up, We\u2019re Dreaming\u2019s starry-eyed theme and little else.\nHis third go-round in the scoring arena, for Yann\u2019s latest Knife + Heart, was surprise-released last week in anticipation of the film\u2019s imminent limited theatrical release; rather than engaging in watered-down retreads of his previous work, Gonzalez breaks from his own soundtracking habits with a sense of playfulness. Part of this new-feeling approach is undoubtedly owed to the subject matter of the film itself\u2014an erotic slasher film that, when not inscrutably immersed in its own atmosphere, centers around a series of mysterious killings on a gay porn set and a leather-masked villain wielding a deadly blade tucked inside a black dildo.\nWith 1970s Paris as its backdrop, Knife + Heart is loaded with enough kitsch to suggest that nostalgia runs deep in the Gonzalez brothers\u2019 bloodline\u2014in order words, a suitable playground for M83\u2019s own past-peddling tendencies. In a press release, Yann stated that he put forth to Anthony \u201cstraight and gay porn [film]\u201d soundtracks as well as the scores that accompanied the filmic work of Giallo masters like Lucio Fulci and Mario Bava; the latter style\u2019s melodramatic sweep shines through in the pounding-and-piping \u201cUn Cocteau Dans Le Coeur,\u201d while the freewheeling and groovy synth line of \u201cDetective Rachid\u201d radiates a grindhouse-esque seediness that mirrors the film\u2019s bawdy-and-bloody approach.\nMore than anything else, though, the score for Knife + Heart\u2014which encompasses bite-sized synth doodles, organ-grinding dread, and vaporous tone-clouds\u2014finds Anthony Gonzalez again recalling his own work, this time in form instead of explicit sound. It\u2019s hard not to hear Knife+Heart\u2019s multifarious approach without thinking of Junk, M83\u2019s quixotic 2016 LP that mostly traded the 4K synth-pop for stately French balladry, glassy keyboards, and schmaltzy, horn-laden hooks.\nJunk represented a conscious retreat from M83\u2019s signature style not unlike French electronic duo Air\u2019s divisive 2001 album and Moon Safari follow-up 10,000 Hz Legend\u2014itself coming off the heels of their shapeshifting, woozy score for Sofia Coppola\u2019s The Virgin Suicides. With his score for Knife + Heart, it\u2019s almost as if Anthony Gonzalez discovered Air\u2019s beaten path and chose to travel it in reverse\u2014a fitting and successful approach for one of the most capable retro fabulists of the last 20 years.\n", "pptitle": ["knife", "heart", "origin", "soundtrack"]}
