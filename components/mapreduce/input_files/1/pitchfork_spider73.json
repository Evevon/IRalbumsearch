The researcher Tom Artiss has written that Inuit music in the 21st century lives at the intersection of ajunamat and sappulik, a word that means to \u201cnever give up.\u201d To pair the two ideas is to join acceptance with resilience. This is certainly true of the Inuk artist Tanya Tagaq\u2019s work. When Moravian missionaries traveled to Canada in the late 18th century, they prohibited Inuit drumming, dancing, and throat singing. Tagaq, on the other hand, fuses them with an array of contemporary styles of music, from downtempo rap to industrial rock to contemporary classical.\nThe adaptability and indomitable spirit of her people are present in Tagaq\u2019s politics, which encompass firm, assured stances on environmentalism, women\u2019s rights, and indigenous rights. Those themes permeate Toothsayer, a companion to the \u201cPolar Worlds\u201d exhibit at London\u2019s National Maritime Museum. Bearing a title that suggests both prescience and defiance\u2014\u201cWe are going to have to get our fists up and our teeth out to carve our way to survival in this world,\u201d Tagaq explained\u2014Toothsayer is both a love letter to the Inuit and a call to arms for the preservation of their culture.\n\u201cIcebreaker\u201d kicks off the EP in devastating fashion. An ominous drone is soon joined by slow, insistent drumming, suggesting something steadily chipping away at indispensable ice. Above the mechanistic beat, Tagaq\u2019s voice oscillates between gasps and growls. It doesn't just sound like a portrait of the merciless Arctic winter, but a meditation on the ecological crisis at hand. Like \u201cIcebreaker,\u201d the rest of the EP\u2019s songs communicate without lyrics. And while much of the instrumentation is thoughtful (the Iranian-British electronic musician Ash Koosha contributed to the delicate \u201cSnowblind\u201d and the raging \u201cSubmerged\u201d), nothing is as potent as Tagaq\u2019s voice.\nHer virtuosity is impressive\u2014she\u2019s able to move between high-pitched squeaks and guttural bellows, gnarly cackling and fierce howls. What\u2019s most affecting, though, is when we hear katajjaq\u2014the vocal game traditionally played among Inuit women while men are away hunting. It involves two women standing face to face, exchanging repetitive vocal motifs until one fails to keep the pattern going. In older recordings of katajjaq, it\u2019s easy to sense just how entertaining they were: Many games end with laughter.\nThe katajjaq we hear across Tagaq\u2019s discography is different\u2014it\u2019s performed solo, and she\u2019s not laughing. On \u201cIcebreaker,\u201d the technique runs through the song only to be suddenly silenced\u2014a suggestion, perhaps, of the impending extinction of many traditional practices\u2014and the way she executes her vocalizing on her own feels like a somber foreshadowing of a time when others won\u2019t be present to join her. On \u201cSubmerged,\u201d her katajjaq is delivered over simple, repetitive percussion that\u2019s reminiscent of Inuit drumming. When the song reaches its climax, Tagaq swerves into piercing shrieks that are bolstered by electrifying guitar-like sounds. The message: Calamity is near, and the Inuit are its victims.\n\u201cPolar Worlds\u201d is about the history of British exploration and scientific enquiry, but it is also about the effects of climate change on the region\u2014a topic central to Tagaq\u2019s work. The issue is serious: Winters are becoming shorter, the weather is getting harsher, the Arctic ice pack grows ever smaller. The livelihood of Inuit people is at stake, and the sustainability of their culture is in danger\u2014the effects of climate change have meant fewer opportunities for younger generations to learn skills their forebears used. If the fury of songs like \u201cIcebreaker\u201d and \u201cSubmerged\u201d is keyed directly to the impending crisis, the same is also true of the melancholy cast of the EP\u2019s quietest songs. In \u201cHypothermia,\u201d her katajjaq takes on the desperate cadence of someone panting, while the crystalline harmonies of \u201cSnowblind\u201d are both a vivid evocation of landscape and a bittersweet expression of pain\u2014the pain of knowing that this could all be gone.\n", "pptitle": ["toothsay", "ep"]}
