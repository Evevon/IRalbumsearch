In the \u201980s. he wrote an essay explaining what products to use on hair as boring as his. He titled a tune \u201cI Love Myself (And I Always Have).\u201d He records when he has enough songs to fill an album, which these days takes a while. About the only rock star thing he\u2019s done in recent years is release a memoir, the most literate of the dozens by artists, boho ancestors included, who have also entered the memoir stage; Forster\u2019s is written, not assembled.\nThirteen years after the death of his musical partner and best friend Grant McLennan put an end to the triumphant second-act return of the Go-Betweens, Inferno finds Robert Forster in a typically reflective mode, but one with a spring in his step. The man who often sang as if he were a library quiet room in human form finally gets caught out. Thanks to Victor Van Vugt (Nick Cave, Beth Orton),  Forster\u2019s seventh solo album has a presence and warmth missing from 2015\u2019s emaciated Songs to Play; it\u2019s as if he thought his tunes then were so strong that they required no embellishment. From his wife Karin B\u00e3umler\u2019s violin in \u201cOne Bird in the Sky\u201d to Earl Havin\u2019s muted kick drum on manifesto \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Tell It,\u201d Inferno tests Forster\u2019s commitment to rock and roll: he wants it punchy but with folk and classical filigrees too. That\u2019s fine\u2014the Go-Betweens also made a career out of an ambivalent relationship to rock. Inferno won\u2019t sell in the millions. Forster knows it. He sounds chipper anyway, as if saying, \u201cEh, fuck it.\u201d\nIf Inferno should become his last record, then he\u2019s circled back to his first: the Go-Betweens\u2019 1978 \u201cLee Remick\u201d/\u201cKaren\u201d single, which praised a librarian for introducing him to Genet and Brecht. In those days, Forster came off as a virgin whose songs fashioned the images of the women he sought\u2014the classic learning curve of the heterosexual poet. In B\u00e3umler he\u2019s found a musical and intellectual equal. He opens the record with William Butler Yeats\u2019 poem \u201cCrazy Jane on the Day of Judgement,\u201d set to a shuffling beat and piano lines that lighten an exchange between a woman who desires a love that takes \u201cthe whole body and soul\u201d and a would-be male lover who would \u201cscoff and lour\u201d at her demands. Saving all this from preciousness are B\u00e3umler\u2019s keening background vocals: she plays a woman imprisoned by a poetic dude\u2019s presumptions. Her violin also coaxes \u201cRemain,\u201d about Forster\u2019s resolution and independence, into bloom.\nInevitable, really, that this Velvet Underground fan would find a simpatico partner in a musician who scratched welcome dissonances out of a string instrument. He thanked B\u00e3umler as early as 1990\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ve Been Looking for Somebody,\u201d a passing angel jonesing for a smoke. \u201cThe party\u2019s over, then she came,\u201d he sang, atremble with gratitude. The rest of the band, dubbed by Forster the Magic Five, go tight or loose as the material requires, a marriage adapting to the times. Havin\u2019s bongos and Scott Bromiley\u2019s low sustained organ chords give  \u201cLife Has Turned a Page\u201d a goofiness often missing in Forster\u2019s work, equivalent at least to \u201cthat striped sunlight sound\u201d description to which the Go-Betweens often aspired.\nIn 2008 Forster released The Evangelist, an album that wasn\u2019t haunted by the ghost of Grant McLennan so much as Forster had made McLennan\u2019s words into flesh, or, rather, his melodies. Forster\u2019s partner wasn\u2019t dead; he was right here, buoying \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Easy\u201d and \u201cDemon Days.\u201d   Offering itself as a coda if, say, his non-fiction becomes more than a sideline, Inferno shimmies with the vigor of a man who can keep this up so long as the tunes, one a year if necessary, keep coming. Just don\u2019t press him. As \u201cOne Bird in the Sky\u201d reminds listeners, \u201cI eat only when I eat.\u201d\n", "pptitle": ["inferno"]}
