It\u2019s a curious statement to end a clip in which he wanders around a set-decorated house and explains his sartorial style as \u201cPacific Coast Americana,\u201d which I think is based on the preppy kids who always got beaten up in 1960s biker flicks\u2014the culture instead of the counterculture. That insistence that he\u2019s not staging anything is even more curious coming from an artist who specializes in midcentury-modern rock\u2019n\u2019roll, a studious collision of 1950s rockabilly, \u201960s pop, and old-school R&B from Memphis, New Orleans, and New York. Like JD McPherson and Eli \u201cPaperboy\u201d Reed, Waterhouse is a revivalist who insists he\u2019s not a revivalist, a contradiction that extends beyond his dress code to his music.\nSuperficially, the Southern California native gets everything just so. Waterhouse recorded his fourth album exclusively in analog, of course, and he knows how to assemble a song so that it sounds just slightly uprooted from any one historical scene or style. \u201cSong for Winners\u201d opens with a Duane Eddy guitar lick before launching into a swaggering Nuggets garage rocker, with Waterhouse slightly sneering his vocals to sound a little bit like the Standells\u2019 Larry Tamblyn. There\u2019s a gronky sax solo and a spy-surf guitar solo. The song is pan-nostalgic: crammed with all sorts of old, familiar sounds, yet they all make sense in this assemblage, more or less. Waterhouse scrambles our expectations of old-school musical styles while underscoring how much pure listening joy can be found in these elements.\nYet Nick Waterhouse can\u2019t really make them add up to much beyond themselves. His references remain references. When he plays a rock instrumental, it\u2019s so close to the Champs\u2019 biggest hit that you might find yourself reflexively yelling, \u201cTequila!\u201d Maybe he\u2019s too good as his job\u2014or, as he sings on opener \u201cBy Heart,\u201d \u201cNever learn something you can do by heart/Soon as you do it comes apart.\u201d Most everything here sounds precise to the point of fussy, even fetishistic: the tasteful distortion in his vocals, the buzzy roominess of the production, the self-conscious elegance of slower tunes like \u201cThought & Act.\u201d On \u201cWreck the Rod\u201d he has the backing vocalists shout \u201cLove!\u201d at us on the beat, which gives a distinctive, neat-o hook but distracts from Waterhouse\u2019s conflicted ode to masochistic love. At heart these songs sound clever, and clever is the enemy of soul, the clogger of grooves. Perhaps that aspect of the music diminishes onstage, when Waterhouse and his band can cut loose and shed some of that rock-historical baggage, but it makes for an album that\u2019s a little too shirt-and-pants.\n", "pptitle": ["nick", "waterhous"]}
