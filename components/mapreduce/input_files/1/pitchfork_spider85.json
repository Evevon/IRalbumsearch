Solange published last fall, writer Ayana Mathis described the making of the new album as taking the singer back to \u201ca kind of Houston of the mind.\u201d It\u2019s a city that figures heavily in Knowles family mythology as the birthplace of Solange and her sister. At the time of the interview, we didn\u2019t know the name of the record, When I Get Home, which indicates that this is an album about return. Now we have music and an accompanying short film that reconstructs the Houston of Solange\u2019s mind.\nIt\u2019s not literal objectification of the past so much as a future memory of the city, an ephemeral mental grid. See-sawing bass booms from phantom slabs, wood-grained and candy-painted per local tradition. Synthesizers and samples ricochet off the tall, empty office buildings of downtown Houston, reverberating to the heavens. Black cowboys gallop through the dusk\u2014the clip of hooves a drumbeat. Space refuse is treasure. And snatches of vocals from hometown rappers Devin the Dude and Scarface float like murmurs from passing car windows.\nThree years after releasing the soul-baring opus A Seat at the Table, Solange has ditched traditional song structure and world-weary lyrics for a sonically and thematically ambiguous record that feels freer, and less burdened by the white gaze. Although Houston is the beating heart at its core, much like New Orleans pulsed through A Seat, the music\u2019s spectral, free-associative quality suggests that the idea of \u201chome\u201d is less rooted. Solange offers a fundamental lesson of those who leave: Home isn\u2019t something you can possess, it lives on without you. Perhaps she also understands that we can\u2019t trust our memories and so Solange gives her music motion. We slide into this \u201cHouston of the mind,\u201d on a repeated refrain that reinforces the slipperiness of recall: \u201cI saw things\u2026 I imagined/Things\u2026 I imagined.\u201d\nThe music is so in motion it\u2019s hard to pin down. Its obliqueness does not give it automatic significance; instead, like in jazz or drone music, engaged listening instigates feeling. Because Solange doesn\u2019t offer a clear thesis like on A Seat at the Table, the onus falls on the listener to get close and make their own meaning. That can be a liberating creative impulse, particularly for a pop star who is widely considered an auteur. Solange and her musical collaborators\u2014for what it\u2019s worth, nearly all men aside from Abra and Cassie\u2014duck and weave through various time signatures, burying Easter Eggs beneath bold keys, Moog magic, and textured drum lines that embellish the omnipresent low end. There are samples, background vocals, and additional personnel credits to people representing Houston\u2019s past, present, and future: from Phylicia Rashad and the poet Pat Parker, to Solange\u2019s young son Julez Smith II, who has a production credit on the interlude \u201cNothing Without Intention.\u201d\nWhen I Get Home is exploratory, but still kind of glossy. The melodies on \u201cDown With the Clique\u201d and \u201cWay to the Show\u201d could be rearranged remnants from her first album Solo Star, released in her teen pop days. Pharrell, the king of sheen, shows up with his signature four-count intro on \u201cSound of Rain,\u201d a song that perfectly channels the kitschy, pixelated optimism of late \u201990s/early aughts futurism. He also brings his toolkit staples of tightly wound drums and syncopated piano for \u201cAlmeda,\u201d an early fan-favorite because of an unexpected feature by a baby-voiced Playboi Carti who raps about diamonds shining through the darkness on a track where Solange heralds black ownership. We\u2019re in Houston, so only one track hints at the time Solange recently spent in Jamaica. \u201cBinz\u201d is a wall-slapper, waist-winder, booty-popper. The airy three-part harmonies that have been her true calling card since covering the Dirty Projectors\u2019 \u201cStillness Is the Move\u201d ascend over a dense arpeggiated bassline, and then give way to playful back-and-forth toasting between Solange and The-Dream that echoes the incantations of Sister Nancy: \u201cSundown, wind chimes/I just wanna wake up on C.P. time.\u201d\nSolange is frolicking here, using a freeform template that aspires to the endlessly uplifting magic of Stevie Wonder, the psychedelic pleasures of chopped and screwed music, or the spiritual jazz of Alice Coltrane and the Arkestra of Sun Ra. One of her chief collaborators throughout is John Carroll Kirby, whose solo music could only be described as New Age. Standing on the Corner, a young New York City jazz group, provide some sublime moments of drama and tension\u2014a perfect template for the gestural, post-modern, Kate Bush-esque choreography that Solange prefers.\nWhen I Get Home is particularly beautiful as an ambient piece that\u2019s unencumbered by the emotional catharsis of A Seat at the Table\u2014but it is missing a palpable thesis statement. Fourteen of the album\u2019s 19 tracks clock in at under three minutes, but the patchwork effect suggests a more stream-of-consciousness bricolage than, say, Tierra Whack\u2019s idea-led brevity. She\u2019s got a lot of ideas, but I\u2019m still left wondering what this album can tell us about her aesthetic practice. (Despite its title, the interlude \u201cNothing Without Intention\u201d doesn\u2019t provide a clue.) But this need for direction only matters because A Seat at the Table felt so urgent.\nHere, Solange is unhurried. The album rewards repetition, in listening and in execution. Repetition can cue a meditative state; it can also be code. \u201cI saw things I imagined, things I imagined,\u201d she sings on the opener. \u201cWe were down with you, down with you,\u201d she continues on \u201cDown With the Clique.\u201d And by the time she switches up the single phrase repetition on \u201cAlmeda,\u201d listing with pride, \u201cbrown skin, brown face, black skin, black braids,\u201d the album is half over and the mood, the dream state, resets.\nSome spiritual traditions use repeated mantras or prayers to invite awareness and presence, others as a way to invoke the past or alter the future. Design principles teach that repetition communicates unity and cohesion\u2014enter \u201cMy Skin My Logo,\u201d where Solange trades admiring verses with a cooing Gucci Mane, whose name conjures an endless monogram of interlocking Gs. The song itself is childlike and loving; the macho rapper softening his nursery rhyme-flow for something that sounds like an actual nursery rhyme. It\u2019s through repetition that Solange resurrects a timeless, formless Houston of her mind. She uses the device extensively and almost compulsively, trying to remember, trying harder not to forget, and trying even harder to situate these traditions within a wider context of black music and culture in America.\n", "pptitle": ["home"]}
