The \u201cgrey area\u201d in question is her mid-20s, a \u201cstrange place\u201d she\u2019s eager to navigate through and out of, by the sound of it. \u201cI just wrote the album from a place of confusion,\u201d the rapper born Simbi Ajikawo recently told Noisey, making the uncertainty of a quarter-life crisis seem like navigating the fog of war. A similar search for certainty ran through her second album, 2017\u2019s Stillness in Wonderland, a Lewis Carroll-based introspective adventure throughout which she sought a better understanding of self. Armed with lessons from that stumble down the rabbit hole, she is far more assured on GREY Area. It is a coming-of-age marvel.\nWonderland was tangled and overwrought. The album was full of ideas and unsure how to express them. But working on GREY Area, Simz uncovered the source of her disorientation: she was taking in too much outside noise and losing her bearings. In her effort to solve the impossibility of being young and indecisive (coupled with the sensory overload of trekking across Europe), she has improved as a songwriter and storyteller. She is so grounded in her perspective that even her examinations of societal decay feel deeply personal. She buoys these probing looks into the heart of darkness with intimate glimpses from inside her life in motion. The drudgery of touring, the struggle of modern relationships, processing the trauma of a friend getting murdered, each handled with a delicate and deft touch that never dulls her piercing flows. These are the songs of a woman responding to a nebulous time by making her own way forward. \u201cSometimes we do not see the fuckery until we\u2019re out of it,\u201d she explains on \u201cTherapy.\u201d \u201cSome people read The Alchemist and still never amount to shit.\u201d\nThe entire album was produced by Simz\u2019s childhood friend, Inflo. Using more live instruments in place of sampling\u2014guitars, strings, pianos, and drums, mostly\u2014they never settle into one space. No two songs on GREY Area sound the same, even when they\u2019re similar the objectives vary, as she probes into their many grooves. \u201cI\u2019m JAY-Z on a bad day, Shakespeare on my worst days,\u201d she snaps through the scuzzy bass and strings on \u201cOffence.\u201d \u201cTherapy\u201d seems to invert that song\u2019s template for something more downtempo and cleansing. By the time the album settles into the gorgeous bed of \u201cFlowers,\u201d which reunites Inflo with singer and guitarist Michael Kiwanuka, Little Simz has already proven herself a master of her universe.\nAt turns both acerbic and unguarded, GREY Area feels like the grand culmination of everything Simz has been puzzling out to this point. She\u2019s a preternaturally gifted lyricist, a prodigy who recorded her first raps at nine and released her earliest tapes in her teens; it simply took a while for her to apply that acuity to her songcraft. She delivers her wonted precision here, but she doesn\u2019t just slash all beats to ribbons. Sure, there are still savage songs like \u201cVenom,\u201d which finds her darting through sharp, fast-moving bow strokes and claiming the spot in the rap hierarchy the patriarchy sees fit to deny her, but even amid those shows of strength, she sees her ideas through. Little Simz is learning that taking things step by step is the best way to plot a course, and retracing those steps is the easiest way out of the labyrinth.\n", "pptitle": ["grey", "area"]}
