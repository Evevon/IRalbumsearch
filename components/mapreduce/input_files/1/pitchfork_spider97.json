When it worked, he started writing his own raps to avoid being found out. He\u2019s still rapping to girls\u2014sort of. His first full-length project, Pretty Face, is full of (and about) similar performative gestures for a lover and about how such gestures have proven futile. The tracklist, when pieced together as a sentence, is a lyric played in the tape\u2019s opening seconds: \u201cReally, I been tryna tell shorty how beautiful shorty is to me but shorty not tryna hear it from me.\u201d For 34 minutes he tries\u2014and ultimately fails\u2014to salvage an unraveled relationship, but in the process, he gives more shape to his beautiful, muted music.\nSpencer, a mousy 22-year-old rapper from Jamaica Queens who coos his lyrics, makes music for the overthinkers. There aren\u2019t any traces of the historic Queens of hip-hop yore in the verses he intones. He\u2019s blissfully unconcerned with NYC rap lore and restoring the feeling. Picking out his raps can be like catching conversation fragments from someone just barely within earshot, beneath the buzzing murmur in a restaurant. His songs exist in the cracks between the mundane and profound, ruminating on\u2014sometimes through\u2014the everyday struggles of being young and moving forward. He is in search of both the perfectly articulated thought and feeling. \u201cYou gotta be more expressive than you are impressive,\u201d he said last year. Oddly enough, expressiveness has been a problem for the hopeless romantic. His small voice, often obscured to the point of being indistinct in song, has a tendency to be swallowed up in his big ideas. Pretty Face is a rectification, not so much in volume as in the sheer impact of sonic material. Even when his voice is nearly imperceptible here his presence is still palpable.\nRecorded in his bedroom \u201con some depressed shit\u201d in 2018 and personally categorized as the music he made when he didn\u2019t want to make music, Pretty Face plays like Deem Spencer\u2019s meandering revelations amid an undirected recording process. It\u2019s heartbreak hymns for pensive extroverts. The tape builds on the electro-soul blended minimalism of his previous work toward fuller songs. It hits differently. Ironically, these incidental cuts develop with more purpose. Before, when he would disappear into the mix, it felt like he was hiding; now, it feels like an invitation to listen more carefully, to come in closer.\nHis last project, the 2017 EP we think we alone, waded through the fog of grief after the death of his grandfather. Those eight songs were at turns introspective and droll, with the capacity to be even more, but they were also usually withdrawn or shrinking. All his songs paint with a glass-half-empty perspective, but where his last project felt incomplete in almost a fatalistic way these are a bit more configured. Spencer recently revealed that both sunflower and we think we alone were originally meant to be called Pretty Face, but that he kept saving the title for greener pastures. This Pretty Face, though still not released under light circumstances, doesn\u2019t feel as undone.\nWhen a beat breaks off to reveal another, as on the bubbly \u201cshorty pt. 3,\u201d it feels like a decision made with resolution in mind. Several thoughts peek from underneath the overcast conditions to reveal the restorative light of atonement, taking responsibility for the self-sabotaging role he\u2019s played in his own misfortune: \u201cI still feel like coulda, shoulda, wouldn\u2019t/Had burned bridges so I couldn\u2019t be followed,\u201d he sighs on \u201cis.\u201d The bending flows on \u201cbeen\u201d are among his most potent, the impetus for a conversation with the \u201cgirl\u2019s God\u201d on why \u201cwe all can\u2019t love her.\u201d What unfolds next is illuminating: \u201cAnd as a watched, he grew with anger/He said, \u2018I\u2019d expect such hate from a scorned ex-lover, but not from you, a stranger\u2019/I said, \u2018Nah, it ain\u2019t even hate, my brother, not for you, it\u2019s thanks/And I\u2019ma make sure I collect all these cold hard gems that I got from you in banks.\u2019\u201d Not only is Spencer finding relief on the tape, he is treasuring the experience.\nFrom the jazz lounge vibes of \u201cbut\u201d to the slick spitting on \u201cnot tryna hear it,\u201d Deem Spencer turns a tumultuous romance into kindling for a bonfire of self-realization. The songs on Pretty Face aren\u2019t so much about what happens inside a broken relationship as they are what happens after. Through the heartache, Spencer stumbled into a truer sense of identity in his music. When the hurt subsides, all you can do is go on.\n", "pptitle": ["pretti", "face"]}
