Ex Hex\u2019s second album is about garage-rock thrust at its core, like prime Stones and their own debut Rips. Like that LP, it draws a through-line from the Shangri-Las to Blondie to Sleater-Kinney to, well, Ex-Hex.\r\n\r\nThis time, though, pop-metal production shine adds a new meta-textual layer, conjuring visions of the CBGB Class of \u201876 upscaled to the arena rock of \u201986, thanks in part to furniture maker-turned indie-rock production swami Jonah Takagi. It\u2019s nothing but guitars, bass, and drums, but the sound is huge, bulked up with vocal reverb, choice pedals and amps. The latter includes Timony\u2019s miniature Rockman, an iconic tone tool that became a signature of guitarists from Boston\u2019s Tom Scholz \u2014 who invented it \u2014 to Charlotte Caffey, Curt Kirkwood and the dudes in Def Leppard (see pretty much every track of Hysteria).\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s Real is mainly concerned with the bruising-ness of love. Every song involves a second-person addressee; lovers are \u201cblack and blue,\u201d emotionally or otherwise, feeling \u201chaunted\u201d and \u201cmisunderstood,\u201d fading away. It\u2019s rough terrain, but Timony refuses to sulk or back down; this is a record about fighting to stay connected, a commendable impulse right about now. Fittingly, the energy never flags, with plenty of familiar gestures to trainspot. \u201cDiamond Drive\u201d is a pogo-fest with a riff suggesting Lou Reed\u2019s \u201cVicious.\u201d \u201cMedley\u201d conjures latter-day Patti Smith, \u201cBecause the Night\u201d in particular; \u201cRadiate\u201d seems to wink at Blondie; \u201cNo Reflection\u201d echoes Joan Jett\u2019s mighty cover of \u201cCrimson and Clover;\u201d \u201cCosmic Cave\u201d recalls the Ramones cover of \u201cDo You Wanna Dance?\u201d with a non-binary twist.\r\n\r\nThe set ends with \u201cTalk To Me,\u201d positing The Ronettes as a hair metal band, which of course they always were. All told, It\u2019s Real rejigs rock history in both sound and spirit. It resists pat endings where lovers reunite, or crash and burn, or dissolve, as the \u201chero\u201d rambles on to the next town or right-swipe. Instead, it\u2019a about sticking it out, talking it out, love as it\u2019s lived in the world: as struggle and process, not package, as real as the effort you\u2019re willing to put in.", "pptitle": ["ex", "hex", "real", "album", "review", "roll", "stone"]}
