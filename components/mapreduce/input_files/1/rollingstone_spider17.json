Punchlines fly from the get-go (there\u2019s no Vol. 1 or 2), with humanity the usual butt of the jokes, though Trump\u2019s a target, too. Take \u201cTalking Reality Television Blues,\u201d a tribute to Dylan (see \u201cTalking John Birch Society Blues,\u201d \u201cTalking World War III Blues,\u201d etc.) and Woody Guthrie before him that draws a line from Milton Berle\u2019s Texaco Star Theatre through MTV, Fox News and The Apprentice, dissecting the talking blues trope along the way. Snider likes meta: see also \u201cWorking On A Song,\u201d an extended koan that frames the life of a Nashville writer from 22-year-old newbie to a greying bard, still staring at a half-empty page. \u201cThe Ghost of Johnny Cash\u201d conjures an encounter (supposedly true) between Loretta Lynn and the late man in black at Cash\u2019s old mancave, which Rick Rubin helped transform into a studio during the American Recordings sessions, and where this album was cut.\r\n\r\nThe most provocative moments are topical, when Snider takes scalpels to modern cultural cancers and musical histories both. A lean riff on Willie Dixon\u2019s \u201cSpoonful\u201d gets repurposed on \u201cA Timeless Response To Current Events,\u201d with variations of the reprise \u201cain\u2019t that some bullshit?\u201d (In reference to what, you ask? Look at your Twitter feed.) In a similar spirit, if more meta still, is \u201cThe Blues On Banjo.\u201d At first it feels uncomfortably like minstrelsy, as the title itself suggests a sly observation on American music\u2019s African roots. Then it upshifts into hydrant-flow indictment of capitalist villainy, invoking the WWII military-industrial end-run Operation Paperclip, various 9/11 ancillaries, and archetypal NRA-owned politicians \u2014the latter conjured with Jason Isbell and Amanda Shires in a chorus that testifies \u201cThey\u2019re sending out their thoughts and their prayers!\u201d (Or is it \u201cselling out\u2026\u201d?) paced by a Salvation Army tambourine jingle. Border wall hysteria comes to mind as Snider observes \u201cwe mistake desperate people for the devil all the time.\u201d And circling back to the opening, he telescopes an interrogative blues dissertation into an offhanded \u201czip-a-dee-doo-dah, motherfuckers.\u201d Cultural studies majors: have at it.\r\n\r\nBut to be clear, Snider has heart, which is why his wit and erudition virtually never sounds smug, patronizing or overtly self-serving. He\u2019s got hooks, too. See \u201cWatering Flowers In The Rain,\u201d a blues for a former Elvis Presley roadie, who may or may not be bullshitting, though Snider assures us he\u2019s for real in the song's intro. Either way, the ache and weary resignation feel 100% true. The character is a struggler \u2014 like Snider, and a lot of us, too \u2014 and his blues are our own.", "pptitle": ["todd", "snider", "cash", "cabin", "session", "vol", "3", "album", "review", "roll", "stone"]}
