She divorced husband number two, Nickelback\u2019s Chad Kroeger, and was diagnosed with Lyme disease so severe that she was bed-ridden for a period. Alas, Head Above Water is neither a concept album about the life of a liquid-terrified tick nor one about Kroeger; Lavigne insists their breakup was amicable, and her ex is thanked in the credits for \u201cbeginning this album with me and seeing it through to the end.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe record nonetheless comes with its own twist. Along with sophomore slumps, breakup albums remain one of pop\u2019s most enduring traditions. But rarely has anyone sounded both as wrecked and\u00a0rejuvenated over the course of the same record as on Head Above Water, which is an ongoing mood swing set to music. The Lavigne heard at the beginning of the record is almost an entirely different person by the end; the hard part is figuring out which part you like more.\r\n\r\nFor roughly the first third of the album, the heartbroken Lavigne is in sight. She\u2019s fighting \u201cthe calm before the storm,\u201d is \u201clocked up in a cage called love\u201d and \u201cfell in love with the devil.\u201d These songs are largely steeped in the sort of rain-lashed sludge rock heard on (surprise!) Nickelback records. They\u2019re like Blood on the Processed Tracks.\r\n\r\nAbout halfway through, she sounds as if she popped an antidepressant on the way to the studio. Like a teenager after her first major date, she's dreaming of \u201criding bikes at sunset by the ocean\u201d and rhyming \u201cpajamas\u201d with \u201cbananas\u201d as he sings about her new lover finding her sexy. Aptly, the musical settings are far lighter: Suddenly, we\u2019re in the land of carefully plucked acoustic guitars, finger-snapping pop and self-empowerment life lessons. \"Dumb Blonde,\" her kiss-off to those who are \"quick to condescend/Well, you think I'm empty, I'm not,\" lurches jarringly into rap-metal turf in its chorus, complete with a Nicki Minaj cameo.\r\n\r\nWhatever mode she\u2019s in, Lavigne's never sounded stronger or more vocally confident. Her half-yodel on \u201cLove Me Insane\u201d is a hook in itself. And both sides of Lavigne have their merits. She\u2019s guardedly optimistic about a new love in \u201cSouvenir\u201d and appropriately giddy on \u201cBigger Wow,\u201d which seems destined to be a summer jam.\r\n\r\nBut as on her second album, 2004's Under My Skin, she\u2019s just more compelling and far less generic as a troubled adult. With its gloomy, feet-crunching-in snow beats, \u201cBirdie\u201d overcomes its clich\u00e9-a-verse lyric and, her voice spiraling up, breaks free of her burdens. She also sounds more convincing comparing herself to a Viking in the Kroeger-cowritten \u201cWarrior\u201d than going the power-balladeer route in \"Tell Me It's Over.\" You hate to tell someone to stay distraught, but turmoil really suits her.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0", "pptitle": ["review", "avril", "lavign", "goe", "breakuplp", "rout", "head", "water", "roll", "stone"]}
