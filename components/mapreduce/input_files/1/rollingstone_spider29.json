She introduced herself as a Texas songwriter with a sharp eye, a velvet voice and a mean streak, especially when it came to her irreverent attitude toward Nashville pieties. \u201cMy Church\u201d was her profane hymn about hitting the highway, rolling down the windows and blasting Hank Williams on the car radio. From \u201cDrunk Girls Don\u2019t Cry\u201d to \u201c80s Mercedes,\u201d Morris sounded fresh, wry, electric, full of hip-hop and R&B, yet down-home \u2014 the kind of voice people felt like they\u2019d been waiting years to hear.\r\n\r\nThe title track from her new one, Girl, sets the bar high right away. It\u2019s the most ambitious and eccentric song she\u2019s done yet, an emotional powerhouse driven by jagged rock guitar. \u201cMan, that shit\u2019s unflattering,\u201d she begins, before launching into a sisterly pep talk. \u201cGirl, don\u2019t you hang your head low/Don\u2019t you lose your halo,\u201d she sings \u2014 and in case anyone misses the Beyonc\u00e9 reference, she drops an explicit echo of \u201cHalo\u201d into the bridge. \u201cGirl\u201d ventures far from country: That chugging guitar riff could come from early New Wave records by the Cars or the Motels. But that just adds to the song\u2019s bighearted appeal.\r\n\r\nAs \u201cGirl\u201d suggests, this album is where Morris makes her pop move. She\u2019s stretching out musically, going for more of a Selena Gomez-Camila Cabello vibe. She got a taste of the Top 10 last year with \u201cThe Middle,\u201d her surprise EDM hit with Zedd and Grey, which clearly whetted her pop appetite. The high points on Girl have major emotional reach. \u201cA Song for Everything\u201d follows in the style of \u201cMy Church,\u201d as she sings about music memories: \u201cWhat\u2019s your time machine?/Is it Springsteen or \u2018Teenage Dream\u2019?\u201d (Weird footnote: Morris yearns for the good old days \u201cback when Coldplay still played clubs.\u201d)\r\n\r\n\u201cAll My Favorite People\u201d is a country-rock hell-raiser with the Brothers Osborne, lifting a cup to everyone out there who blows their paycheck on weed and booze. \u201cNot everybody drinks on a Tuesday night/Mixes their liquor with Crystal Light\u201d \u2014 but all her favorite people do. \u201cFlavor\u201d is an unexpected nod to ZZ Top\u2019s Eighties synth-rock phase, with some tough talk: \u201cI speak my piece, don\u2019t do what I\u2019m told/\u2018Shut up and sing\u2019? Well, hell no, I won\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite \u201cFlavor,\u201d there\u2019s a lot less salt in her vocals this time. Even the song called \u201cShade\u201d is shade-free. (It\u2019s a piano ballad about seeing all the colors of love.) For the most part, she\u2019s writing happy midtempo love songs about \u201cThe Feels.\u201d If you loved her scrappy attitude on Hero, the change can be hard to take \u2014 especially the bland homilies that clog the album\u2019s second half. But when Morris is on, she can come up with a winner like \u201cMake Out With Me,\u201d where she sends a lusty voicemail while her flame is on the plane, knowing his phone is off, but begging him to come over as soon as he touches down. She might be on her best behavior on this LP, but the liveliest moments come when she gets out of line.", "pptitle": ["review", "maren", "morri", "girl", "roll", "stone"]}
