Now, with racist nationalism on the rise amidst the Brexit debacle, the Special\u2019s third album \u2014 38 years since the last one,\u00a0More Specials\u00a0\u2014 is well timed. As frontman Terry Hall puts it, the band remain \u201chorribly relevant.\u201d\r\nOn this iteration, their numbers have been winnowed significantly: co-founder/songwriter Dammers and singer Neville Staple are out of the picture; drummer John Bradbury and trombonist Rico Rodriguez died within months of each other in 2015. But with signpost singers Terry Hall and Lynval Golding in place, and Horace Panter holding down the bass lines, the classic sound is fairly intact, as is the spirit. The latter seems more to the point, as the set opens with stylistic curveballs. A cover of \u201cBlack Skin Blue Eyed Boys,\u201d an Eddie Grant funk-rock jam, slyly echoes Booket T. and the MGs, Sly and the Family Stone and Talking Heads circa\u00a0Stop Making Sense, kindred mixed-race outfits all. \u201cB.L.M.\u201d works a similar groove, as Golding charts a family history\u00a0from\u00a0Jamaica to England, with the so-called Windrush generation of post-war immigrant worker, and then to the U.S., suffering racist disrespect every step of the way.\r\n\u201cVote For Me\u201d finally rewinds the old sound, dressing down would-be leaders whose \u201cpolitics bore us to tears\u201d over a rub-a-dub jam recalling the band\u2019s swansong Number One hit \u201cGhosttown,\u201d with a trombone outro paying homage to Rodriguez. The band was built on ska covers, and \u201cBlam Blam Fever\u201d revisits the 1960s single by the Valentines, recorded for pioneering Jamaican producer Sonia Pottinger. Here, its gun culture lament gets updated for a new era: \u201cWhat we gonna do/about Amendment number 2,\u201d asks Hall over an irresistible rocksteady bounce; \u201cwe think it is obscene/you can buy AR-15.\u201d A cha-cha-cha version of \u201cThe Lunatics Have Taken Over The Asylum\u201d finds the 1984 single by Specials offshoot Fun Boy Three as fitting a metaphor as ever. Considering Dammers\u2019 absence, the writing is impressive, although hooks could be sharper, and lyrics occasionally stumble. Even if \u201cBreaking Point\u201d is writing its way purposefully into the head of a transphobe, the tossed-off \u201cshemale\u201d reference in a rundown of modern-day stressors feels gratuitous at best.\r\nAs it happens, the album\u2019s highlight is a cover, and the sole track voiced by a guest. \u201c10 Commandments\u201d revisits\u00a0\u201cTen Commandments of Man,\u201d the spoken word hit by the late Jamaican legend Prince Buster, whose music the band built their sound on back in the day (see their covers of \u201cToo Hot\u201d and \u201cEnjoy Yourself\u201d). Here, the original\u2019s noxious battle-of-the-sexes comedy is flipped by\u00a0Saffiyah Khan, a 21-year-old activist whose image went viral when she was photographed standing off against a leader of the anti-Islamic English Defence League at a 2017 rally. Denouncing catcallers and \u201cpseudo-intellectuals on the internet,\u201d Khan\u2019s also echoes the harrowing 1982 rape narrative \u201cThe Boiler,\u201d another Specials side project, recorded by the group with Rhoda Dakar and banned by the BBC at the time. \u201cThou shalt not tell a girl she deserved it because her skirt was too short,\u201d declares Khan, while the band jams on the riddim\u00a0from\u00a0Dawn Penn\u2019s \u201cYou Don\u2019t Love Me (No, No, No),\u201d a cornerstone of Jamaican dancehall history, and a declaration of female self-determination in its own right. The cover is the best sort of revival: old meeting new on equal footing, using the past as a springboard to an improved, remixed future.", "pptitle": ["special", "encor", "british", "skapunk", "legend", "return", "form", "roll", "stone"]}
