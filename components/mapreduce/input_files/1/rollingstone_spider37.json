Fifteen years in, he remains a shapeshifter with excellent taste in shapes.\r\n\r\nOn Tip Of The Sphere, he summons yet another West Coast spirit: Jerry Garcia. As a head who followed the band in their final years, and who was bold enough to cover \u201cDark Star\u201d on 2016\u2019s Day Of The Dead tribute, McCombs brings a certain amount of authority to the ceremony. But he\u2019s an economical guitarist, and the vibe here is mostly late-Seventies Dead, grooves more burbling than rushing. The opener \u201cI Followed The River South To What\u201d echoes the squishy, envelope-filter guitar voicings of innumerable \u201cScarlet Begonias/Fire On The Mountain\u201d jams alongside Dan Horne\u2019s paddleboat bass lines, while Dan Lead\u2019s pedal steel on \u201cPrayer For Another Day\u201d and \u201cRounder\u201d recalls Garcia\u2019s decidedly un-Nashville style.\r\n\r\nNone of this should suggest the approach is overly derivative or slavish. To the contrary; and it takes balls and vision to revitalize these tropes. See \u201cThe Great Pixley Train Robbery,\u201d which begins with an acoustic guitar flourish suggesting a Tommy outtake, then steps into the great 20th century tradition of the train song, following Robert Hunter and many before him. McCombs writes of a railroad heist that actually occurred a century ago in California, narrating it as a confession by a man hoping for closure if not redemption. \u201cI swear before Notary,\u201d he declares, \u201cto make a clean breast/Of the whole thing,\u201d before ripping into a swirling, multi-tracked guitar jam over a snaky Mars Hotel groove.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, the matrix of influences shifts. \u201cAmerican Canyon Sutra\u201d suggests Allen Ginsberg and Suicide\u2019s Alan Vega, indicting Walmart culture over synth beats, electronic splats, and Funkadelic guitar noise. And \u201cSleeping Volcanoes\u201d \u2014 certain to be referred to as \u201cThe Armageddon Song\u201d \u2014 scrambles vintage tunecraft with evocations of refugees and class war, its romantic-apocalyptic reprise recalling,\u00a0in an unnerving juxtapostion of real-world horror and pleasure-center popcraft, McCombs\u2019 \u201cAids In Africa,\u201d from his 2003 debut A. It\u2019s deceptively chill music that, like most of McCombs work, honors the past while steeling itself for the future.", "pptitle": ["cass", "mccomb", "conjur", "grate", "dead", "new", "tip", "sphere", "roll", "stone"]}
