But she\u2019s always had bigger things in mind for her music; 2014\u2019s Are We There was a haunted cathedral of stark synths, orchestral shadow play and stormy guitar drama. Her fantastic new album, Remind Me Tomorrow, ups her ambitions even further, pushing toward a grand, smoldering vision of pop that can bring to mind Lana Del Rey and St. Vincent (producer John Congleton has worked with both), and the New Wave warrior-queen spirit of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs\u2019 Karen O.\r\n\r\nVan Etten\u2019s previous LPs rode a sepulchral slow-burn. This music is just as expansive, but the songs are sharply sculpted. \u201cNo One\u2019s Easy to Love\u201d is a hazy intimation of regret with a head-slap groove; on the hot single \u201cComeback Kid,\u201d Van Etten sounds like an imperious Eighties MTV avenger, punching her way through gossamer synths and Phil Collins-huge tom-tom rumble. \u201cJupiter 4\u201d is like a torch-ballad version of the interplanetary jazz David Bowie explored on Blackstar.\r\n\r\nThe music\u2019s immediacy is reflected in a new generosity in her lyrics. The album opens with Van Etten alone at the piano for \u201cI Told You Everything\u201d: \u201cSitting at the bar, I told you everything/You said, \u2018Holy shit,\u2019\u2009\u201d she sings. The song evolves into a lushly spacey Portishead-style track as she sings about holding hands, sharing a shot, and a confidence that transcends bad memories. She locates the Springsteen-ian nostalgia in the surging \u201cSeventeen\u201d and sums up the exasperated joy of becoming a new parent in the tender trip-hop/soul ballad \u201cYou Shadow\u201d: \u201cUse loving words and be gentle and kind,\u201d she advises, like an indie-rock Mr. Rogers.\r\n\r\nThe most striking moment might be \u201cMalibu,\u201d a swaying California car song about \u201ca couple dudes who don\u2019t give a fuck\u201d falling in love as they drive down Interstate 101. It\u2019s gorgeous yet ringed by scary electronics \u2014 like a Joni Mitchell song lost in a Suicide synth-punk dirge, or like Malibu itself, a paradise recently ravaged by wildfires. Yet if the fear is timely, the freedom she sings about \u2014 and embodies throughout the album \u2014 feels eternal.", "pptitle": ["sharon", "van", "etten", "remind", "tomorrow", "pop", "song", "edg", "roll", "stone"]}
