As the Sixties dream cratered, a golden era peaked in Laurel Canyon \u2014 think Joni, Jackson, Sweet Baby James \u2014 with a tendency towards wistful solipsism. Now, a new one is blooming as the American experiment contemplates its doom. Father John Misty\u2019s cosmic snark, Mitski\u2019s aching character studies, Kurt Vile\u2019s transcendent vagueness \u2014 all of them offer strangely comforting proof that hopelessness springs eternal.\r\n\r\nAdd Los Angeles\u2019 Phoebe Bridgers to that list. Her tenderly spooky 2017 debut, Stranger In The Alps, was followed by last year\u2019s dazzling Crosby, Stills & Nash-style Boygenius EP, cut with kindred aces Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker. Now, the 24-year-old Bridgers has another low-key supergroup. The debut by Better Oblivion Community Center opens in the voice of a seasonal hire on \u201cI Didn\u2019t Know What I Was In For,\u201d searching for meaning in a world so full of pain it can drive a person literally insane.\r\n\r\nShe's soon joined by BOCC\u2019s other half: Conor Oberst. Twenty-five years in, he\u2019s a touchstone for a new generation, Bridgers in particular. His emo shiver has become more tremor than seizure; on his recent Ruminations and Salutations LPs, he channeled a complicated, weary dolor. The duo harmonize beautifully, Oberst\u2019s voice often just a brooding floorboard creak behind Bridgers\u2019 brightly bloodshot confidences (see \u201cChesapeake\u201d). As personas, they\u2019re a duo of damaged survivors, a more dissolute version of Please Like Me\u2019s Josh and Arnold.\r\n\r\nBridgers has a knack for cultivating vocal collaborations. On Stranger In The Alps, John Doe added harmony on her calling card, \u201cKiller,\u201d and Oberst pitched in on \u201cWould You Rather,\u201d a haunting song about Bridgers and her little brother. More recently, she enlisted Jackson Browne on her cover of McCarthy Trenching\u2019s \u201cChristmas Song.\u201d With boygenius, she's found a harmony that's more than the sum of its formidable parts.\r\n\r\nAs social media leaves us paradoxically more isolated than ever, the sound of voices literally finding strength together is a potent metaphor. \u201cBig Black Hearts\u201d locates a vaguely Bonnie-and-Clyde-ish communion in joyously ugly guitar noise, while \u201cDominos,\u201d a song staggering into the thin light after an all-night bender, looks towards something less than hope, but preferable to numbness. \u201cI'm car-pooling to kingdom come/Into the wild purgatory,\u201d the pair sing in the wake of a gushing Nick Zinner guitar solo, clearly glad to have the company for the ride.", "pptitle": ["review", "better", "oblivion", "commun", "center", "soft", "rock", "hard", "time", "roll", "stone"]}
