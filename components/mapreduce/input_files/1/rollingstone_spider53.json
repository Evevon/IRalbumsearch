Their penchant for huge choruses and hyper-neurotic lyrics made tracks like \"Chocolate\" and \"Love Me\" leap out of radios; leader Matty Healy possesses the wiry energy of rock's most beloved vocalists and the thinking-out-loud candor of the post-Livejournal generation.\r\nBut calling them a rock band would be a fool's errand, and their third record, the spectacular, genre-melding\u00a0A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships, proves that even further. A sprawling, thoughtful LP that grapples with the big issues of our time in cheeky and mournful ways, it's a poison-pen love letter to the interiority forced upon its audience by social media, piercing through the flatly punctuation-mark-free affect that dominates online chatter with brute-force musical curiosity and a well-placed gospel choir or two.\r\nThe scream-along \"Love It If We Made It,\" which repurposes nihilistic trending topics into hope for bonhomie amidst soul-deadening anomie, and the percolating \"Give Yourself A Try,\" a note to Healy's younger self that speeds up and refracts The Strokes' \"Hard to Explain,\" fall somewhere in the jittery, riff-heavy modern-rock ideal. But much of\u00a0Inquiry\u00a0takes on the trend of dourness that's washed over pop these past few years and flips it into explorations of the self, propelled by a streaming-era knack for zig-zag-ing through genres in seconds\u2014sophistipop fades into jazz fades into big-ticket MOR fades into Quiet Storm. Call it a brief inquiry into the state of the all-ballad playlist: \"Surrounded By Heads and Bodies,\" which places its spare poem about a rehab friend of Healy's beneath a winking\u00a0Infinite Jest\u00a0reference, is a haze of bedroom-studio guitars and swirling synths; the pleading \"I Couldn't Be More In Love\" glistens like a single tear falling down a cheek, Healy's anguished vocal joining forces with a gospel choir over icy keyboards; and \"Mine\" mashes together brushed drums, static electricity, a solo by the late jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove, and Healy's crushed-velvet delivery.\r\n\"Sincerity Is Scary,\" proclaims the title of one\u00a0Inquiry\u00a0standout among many, a shuffling rumination on the gaps between people that underscores Healy's hoped-for leap into faith with a gospel choir. But on this stunning album, The 1975 take on that overwhelming anxiety with nerve and aplomb, and the result combines the fist-raising inspired by anthems with the gut-punch provided by precisely described longing.", "pptitle": ["review", "1975", "melt", "genr", "heart", "brief", "inquiri", "onlin", "relationship", "roll", "stone"]}
