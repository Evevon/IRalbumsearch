Flexing the storytelling skills he\u2019s flaunted in songs and concert banter for decades, Bruce Springsteen rose to the moment with his 2016 autobiography\u00a0Born to Run\u00a0and the subsequent\u00a0Springsteen on Broadway, his (mostly) one-man meta-jukebox-musical, which ends its year-plus New York City run this month. It\u2019s now both a Netflix film and 2.5 hour soundtrack LP \u2014 a model of modern, multi-platform art-making, both for its success and for the quality of each iteration.\r\nThe LP was produced, like the film, before an audience at the Walter Kerr Theater, a precise replica of the stage show, in turn based closely on the book: the Foreword, rejigged, is the opening monologue; narrative segments mirror chapters. The result is by turns audiobook, podcast, and live album, and at its most potent when it becomes a hybrid of the three.\r\nIt does this straightaway with \u201cGrowing Up,\u201d the abstracted coming-of-age tale from Springsteen\u2019s 1973 debut, here a 12-minute sprawl of talking blues, cabaret spiel, pulpit pounding and stand-up. He sings a verse, then veers into an account of his rock and roll conversion and success as a 7-year-old Elvis Presley mime, with well-honed dramatic pauses, while fingerpicking the looped melody on his acoustic. Then he veers into the next verse. Rather than thwarting the song\u2019s momentum, he transforms it, stories and song building off each other.\r\nHe does it again, to devastating effect, on \u201cMy Father\u2019s House\u201d \u2014 blowing harmonica, singing with trembling gravity, then recounting a dream of watching himself perform on stage in front of thousands of people while crouched alongside his dad. Springsteen touches his arm, and says \u201cThat guy on stage \u2014 that\u2019s how I see you.\u201d I\u2019ve wept every time I\u2019ve heard it.\r\nEventually things settle into an acoustic Bruce show, like those on the 1995-97\u00a0Devils and Dust\u00a0tour, setlist optimized towards the autobiographical.\u00a0Springsteen on Broadwayreprises that tour\u2019s \u201cBorn In The U.S.A.\u201d (see\u00a0Dublin \u201896) \u2014 reframing with 12-string acoustic as a bottleneck blues, part Leadbelly, part Fred McDowell, and reclaiming its protest-song birthright. The show also revisits \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad,\u201d with a speech decrying people in \u201cin the highest offices in our land\u201d who \u201cwant to destroy the idea of an America for all.\u201d\r\nThe heart of\u00a0Springsteen on Broadway\u00a0isn\u2019t politics, however. It\u2019s about family and love, the struggle to escape your roots and own them. Springsteen recites the Lord\u2019s Prayer \u2014 seared into his memory through reluctant years in Catholic school \u2014 and ends the show with his own prayer: \u201cBorn to Run.\u201d He caps it with the sound of a heartbeat, tapping it out with his hand on the body of his acoustic guitar, until it falls silent. It\u2019s a better metaphor for his life\u2019s work than anything I could write here.", "pptitle": ["springsteen", "broadway", "soundtrack", "album", "review", "roll", "stone"]}
