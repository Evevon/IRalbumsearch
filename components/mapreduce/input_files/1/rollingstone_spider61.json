Commercially the move was a disaster, and, in some ways, their fourth LP, Delta,\u00a0is the kind of course correction you\u2019d expect, turning toward an eclectic vision of pop with help from producer Paul Epworth (Adele, Coldplay). The sparse, digital beats on \u201cPicture You\u201d and \u201cWoman\u201d could be pasted in from a Khalid track, and the single \u201cGuiding Light\u201d spritzes their signature barrel-chested group vocals and manly strumming with angelic electronics. Elsewhere, Epworth uses tricks to give string-band instrumentation a hypnotic feel that can recall West African guitar blues.\r\n\r\nThe problem with\u00a0Delta\u00a0is that it feels overwhelmed by its ambitions. The Mumfords constantly fall into the trap of confusing seriousness with grimness, revealing the goth soul lurking beneath their folkie exterior. \u201cCome and suffer here,\u201d Mumford growls on the woeful stomper \u201cSlip Away,\u201d like he\u2019s MC\u2019ing the grand opening of a trauma ward for people afflicted with too much emo. Many of these songs deal with what the band calls \u201cthe four D\u2019s: death, divorce, drugs and depression.\u201d \u201cIf I Say\u201d evokes two D\u2019s at once, decking out a fading relationship with lachrymose imagery (\u201cThe innocence in your face/Bled out without a trace\u201d). These dark obsessions weigh down the music. On \u201cThe Wild,\u201d soft, detailed prettiness and Mumford\u2019s tenderly rumbling baritone get swallowed in lugubrious orchestration; even worse is \u201cDarkness Visible,\u201d in which Americana artist Gill Landry reads from\u00a0Paradise Lost\u00a0over a track that suggests Trent Reznor gone all\u00a0A Beautiful Mind.\r\n\r\nMumford\u2019s arcane notions of romance don\u2019t lighten things much; in \u201cForever,\u201d he gets his puritan scold on: \u201cI\u2019ve known pious women/Who have led such secret lives/Shameless in the dark/So shameful in the light.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man just wasn\u2019t made for these times \u2014 which gets to a paradox at the heart of\u00a0Delta.\u00a0The Mums were much more likable back when they were pretending to be coal miners who churned their own butter. Compared to this stuff, that was a decent look.", "pptitle": ["review", "mumford", "son", "epic", "bummer", "delta", "roll", "stone"]}
