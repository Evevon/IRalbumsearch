There have been subtle placements of his music in NBA broadcasts, less-subtle and omnipresent placements on Dr. Dre\u2019s Beats 1 streaming service, even\u00a0a free promotional carnival in .Paak's hometown of Oxnard, California\u00a0to celebrate his new LP.\r\n\r\nBut his supporters shouldn\u2019t worry. While Oxnard can\u2019t compare to .Paak\u2019s celebrated 2016 breakthrough Malibu, there\u2019s plenty of evidence to confirm that he remains an energetic and vivacious artist, full of good humor. Remarkably, Paak remains an anomaly: No one else is as dedicated to upbeat and funky hip-hop soul as the 32-year-old singer, rapper and drummer. Even when his open-ended vamps with backing band The Free Nationals meander a bit too long, and he struggles to conjure choruses as memorable as his kinetic performances, his songs dazzle simply because of his magnetic, cheerful presence.\r\n\r\nOxnard begins with \u201cThe Chase,\u201d and a too-brief vocal interlude from Kadhja Bonet, a too-little-known L.A. singer known for her revival of psychedelic sunshine soul. Her dreamy invitation that \u201cI need you more than you could know\u201d is hardly indicative of the bubbly grooves to come. (However, its mood is later replicated by the haunted love streams of \u201cTrippy.\u201d) The next track, \u201cHeadlow,\u201d kicks in with a salacious churn and ends with the sound of a blowjob thwarted by a car crash. It\u2019s all a segue to \u201cTints,\u201d a meditation on fame and desire for tinted windows that\u2019s full of post-disco bounce. Some reviewers complained that the Kendrick Lamar-assisted jam was too slick and hollow when it dropped as a preview single last month, but its Shalamar-like pop melody sounds just fine here.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of moments where Oxnard clicks, like the chugging, bum-rush rhythm \u201cWho R U?\u201d It may be the closest .Paak gets here to pure street funk bliss. Then there\u2019s \u201cCheers,\u201d where Paak pays tribute to Mac Miller\u2014the two collaborated on what was arguably the late rapper\u2019s best single, 2016\u2019s \u201cDang!\u201d \u201cHow do you tell a nigga \u2018slow it down\u2019/When you\u2019re living just as fast as him?\u201d he asks. As the bulbous, bass-driven beat slows to a haunting, piano-inflected crawl, he sings, \u201cI should be with you/Damn it, I miss you.\u201d Then Q-Tip (who co-produced the track) appears to reflect on Phife Dawg\u2019s passing. It makes for a poignant, cathartic five minutes.\r\n\r\nStill, there are missed opportunities. Some of the album\u2019s best tracks like \u201c6 Summers\u201d \u2013 where Paak cheekily turns a bizarre fantasy about a supposed Trump love child into a party chant \u2013 sway and churn with no clear direction. Meanwhile, Dre\u2019s engineering role proves a mixed blessing. While the good doctor applies his mixing skills with the loving touch of a man polishing a Chevy Chevelle, resulting in the aural equivalent of a Hollywood blockbuster lathered in Dolby-quality boom, much of what made Paak\u2019s early work so fantastic is forgotten. There\u2019s none of the grungy Blaxploitation soul that fueled Yes Lawd!, his 2016 NxWorries project with L.A. beat loop expert Knxwledge, even though it was that group\u2019s 2015 \u201cSuede\u201d single that reportedly inspired Dre to sign Paak in the first place. Enigmatic crate-digging genius and fellow Oxnard native Madlib isn\u2019t here either, despite early reports that suggested otherwise. However, 9th Wonder orchestrates a spooky organ loop for \u201cSaviers Road.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Paak soldiers on. Whether pimping too hard on the undercooked bonus track \u201cSweet Chick,\u201d or holding his own with Pusha T over the scratchy funk-rock of \u201cBrother\u2019s Keeper,\u201d he remains fully engaged. Oxnard doesn\u2019t fulfill his dreams for creating a West Coast hip-hop soul epic for the age, but it\u2019s not for lack of trying.", "pptitle": ["review", "andersonpaak", "vivaci", "oxnard", "strive", "calihiphop", "epic", "roll", "stone"]}
