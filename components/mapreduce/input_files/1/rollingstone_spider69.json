The result is a probing collection of understated indie-folk.\r\nTweedy takes a laid-back, contented singer-songwriter approach not dissimilar to the down-tempo mood of Wilco's most recent offering, Schmilco. As the title suggests, there\u2019s a reassuring familiarity to much of Warm, with several songs, like \u201cLet\u2019s Go Rain\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Forget,\u201d leaning more heavily on country-roots textures than anything Tweedy has done since at least Being There. Many of the songs here gently gesture towards Tweedy\u2019s past work: the opening chord progression to \u201cHaving Been Is No Way To Be\u201d recalls Tweedy\u2019s \u201cYou Are Not Alone\u201d (written for Mavis Staples); the fingerpicked intro to \u201cFrom Far Away\u201d hints at earlier acoustic numbers like \u201cForget the Flowers.\u201d\r\nBut the easygoing arrangements on Warm bely a much darker, conflicted undercurrent running through Tweedy\u2019s writing. If his longstanding difficulties and insecurities were always present just barely beneath the surface on Wilco's classic records, they are starkly prominent and central to what is often a deeply moving new LP.\r\nThe 51-year-old singer-songwriter grapples with mortality more head-on than ever on songs like \u201cWarm (When The Sun Has Died)\u201d and \u201cFrom Far Away.\u201d Elsewhere, Tweedy seems to be working through deep familial pain, and he's sharper than ever on one of his trademark topics: the breakdown of intimate communication: \u201cI know it\u2019s a lie,\u201d he sings on the highlight \u201cI Know What It\u2019s Like, \u201cwhen you say it\u2019s okay.\"\r\nWith his veteran band currently on hiatus, this is convincing proof that Jeff Tweedy\u2019s non-Wilco detours have become more than mere side projects to fill gaps between albums but rather, precious, intimate portraits of a songwriter who\u2019s willing to openly display more of his scars than ever before.", "pptitle": ["review", "jeff", "tweedi", "plung", "fear", "warm", "roll", "stone"]}
