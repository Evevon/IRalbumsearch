As early as the late Seventies, the late David S. Ware was combining blissful melodicism with mighty fervor in a way that pointed directly back to those influences. From the early Nineties through 2007 Ware led a celebrated quartet that garnered him wide acclaim \u2014\u00a0Rolling\u2019s Stone\u2018s David Fricke called him a \u201cradiantly confident player\u201d in a review of the group\u2019s 1995 album\u00a0Cryptology\u2014 and even a brief major-label deal.\r\n\r\nThis newly released live set\u00a0from the 2010 installment of annual NYC free-iazz summit the Vision Festival documents a relatively short-lived but highly potent trio with bassist William Parker (a holdover from the quartet) and drummer Warren Smith (an alum of Van Morrison\u2019s famed\u00a0Astral Weeks\u00a0session), formed after the quartet dissolved. While the earlier band performed Ware\u2019s dramatic themes and the occasional standard, this lineup favored pure improvisation. That approach makes\u00a0The Balance\u00a0a severe listen, but also an excellent showcase for the saxist\u2019s art at its most elemental. On this continuous three-part performance, he moves between deep sustained tones, extended through circular breathing, and squalling runs that retain a devotional focus even when they reach peak turbulence. Smith\u2019s rumbling toms and dancing cymbal-bell work, and Parker\u2019s rich, resonant undercurrent buoy the leader with a fierce yet articulate flow.\r\n\r\nA series of studio-outtake bonus tracks, which the trio recorded about six months earlier, expand the instrumental palette \u2014 Ware performs on soprano-sax variant the saxello in addition to tenor and Smith adds in tympani and auxiliary percussion \u2014 but achieve a similar brand of meditative communion.", "pptitle": ["album", "review", "david", "s", "ware", "balanc", "roll", "stone"]}
