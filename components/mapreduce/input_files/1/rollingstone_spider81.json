In the ensuing five years, mainstream country has mostly embraced the template that \u201cCruise\u201d offered: male voices singing about partying and women over slick, pop-savvy production. The ethos of the Pistol Annies, who steep their classicist country \u2014 rife with despair and misfortune \u2014 in rootsy arrangements, has not been welcomed within the mainstream confines of the genre in some time.\r\n\r\nTheir solution? Doubling down on the roots blend they\u2019ve honed over the better part of the past decade, merging Monroe\u2019s East Tennessee bluegrass roots, Presley\u2019s hardscrabble Kentucky country-rock and Lambert\u2019s Texas honky-tonk. On paper, the Annies\u2019 latest, like its predecessors, focuses on the type of small-town domestic drama for which the group has become known. Their songs are populated by men and women struggling with prescription medication, marriage, mid-life crises and malaise (and medicating with marijuana).\r\n\r\nBut unlike past efforts, where their narratives relied on a heavy dose of dark humor, the songs on Interstate Gospel convey a much more intimate personal urgency. The result, from the housewife harmony blues on \u201cBest Years of My Life\u201d to Lambert\u2019s haunting post-divorce balladry on \u201cMasterpiece,\u201d is a sharply-rendered sketch of bruised hearts and shaken souls that amounts to the group\u2019s most moving work to date.\r\n\r\nMuch of the success of LP 3 can be chalked up to the songwriting, which is sharper, deeper and funnier than ever. Songs like \"When I Was His Wife\" and \"Commissary\" follow the crying-while-laughing pathos of John Prine, telling stories of bleak misfortune with a shrugging smirk. When they spit out a trademark one-liner (\"even old Moses was a basket case\"), they do so sparingly, often in the precise moment when their otherwise sad-sack narratives could use a pick-me-up. And when the group does write in the third person, like \"Cheyenne,\" an ode to a woman unencumbered by menial jobs and eager men, they end up showing more of themselves in their characters than ever before.\r\n\r\nOver the past five years, Monroe, Presley and Lambert have each lived out some of the earth-shaking life-changes \u2014 marriage, divorce, giving birth \u2014 that they\u2019ve spent their careers deftly documenting in song, and on Interstate, the Annies are singing and writing from the other side of heartbreak and eternal love, freshly formed families and recently broken ones. This album reflects a stirring closeness to their material, from the newly-single manifesto \u201cGot My Name Changed Back\u201d to the newly-single lament \u201cLeavers Lullaby.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019d be no such thing as leaving,\u201d Monroe sings with devastating clarity on the latter, \u201cif just loving somebody was enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the most affecting element of Interstate Gospel may be the group\u2019s more sharpened focus on ancestry and lineage, the ways in which familial traditions, traumas and patriarchal practices get passed on from generation to the next. \u201cMilkman\u201d is a moving sketch of a mother-daughter relationship delivered with profound empathy, and the album\u2019s centerpiece is \u201c5 Acres of Turnips,\u201d a bluegrass blues steeped in Sixties girl-group pop that employs one family\u2019s ambiguously troubled past as a subtle metaphor, perhaps, for the haunted legacy of the American South. In the song, Presley and Lambert conjure Bobbie Gentry\u2019s \u201cOde to Billie Joe,\u201d the Band\u2019s \u201cKing Harvest (Will Surely Come) and Kacey Musgraves\u2019 \u201cMerry Go Round\u201d as they sketch out the rough details of a family long plagued by its own buried history. \u201cGenerations of shame,\u201d Lambert sings, \u201cin my grandaddy\u2019s name.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe 14 songs on Interstate Gospel tell a tightly-woven story about adult restlessness, bittersweet farewells and hard-won independence. Several albums into their own individual and collective career, the Pistol Annies are less interested in singing about burning down their ex-husbands' houses than in burning up their own dull lives in order to start anew. \"Living wild and exhausted,\" as the Pistol Annies put it. \"Paying what it cost to feel so free.\"", "pptitle": ["review", "pistol", "anni", "interst", "gospel", "roll", "stone"]}
