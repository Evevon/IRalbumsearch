When he broke out in 2014 with the contemplative mixtape The Water (S), Jenkins seemed to exist outside of the general rap universe: he collaborated with a small roster of underground MCs while espousing at times sanctimonious views on self-improvement, the ills of society and the shallowness of other rappers. Jenkins' voice--alternatively booming and restrained--sounded like some sort of doomsday robot' aided by sparse, unconventional production steeped in jazz and ambient music; he convincingly played the part of rap savior chosen to awaken the masses, even if a large hunk of the masses had no idea who he was.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut Jenkins' intelligence and commitment to craft can work against him. Listening to his full-length projects in a single sitting can sometimes feel laborious rather than inspiring, like if your favorite college professor kept lecturing hours after class was supposed to end. His 2016 album The Healing Component was overlooked and uneven; he seemed stuck between making a separate artistic statement from The Water (S) and losing the fan base that devoted themselves to it, which resulted in an album that often lacked an identity. Pieces of a Man, Jenkins' second album, finds him loosening up, or at least exerting more self-control. His rhymes on Pieces, as always, are dexterous and learned, layered and clever, but he\u2019s taking himself less seriously, and in the process having some fun. There\u2019s still proselytizing, to be sure, but he\u2019s stopped trying to convince others of his superior knowledge and talent. \u201cI be on my show and prove, not my show-and-tell,\u201d he raps on \u201cBarcelona.\u201d It\u2019s a subtle shift that nonetheless makes Pieces of a Man his most confident and listenable project in years. \r\n\r\nLike many of his Chicago peers, Jenkins' raps sound like they could be spoken word poems, and it's fitting that he borrowed the title for this album from poet Gil Scott-Heron's 1971 debut. In the spirit of Scott-Heron,\u00a0Jenkins is a master of a kind of hip-hop free-association, breathlessly stringing together long runs of metaphors and\u00a0biting\u00a0wordplay. \u201cThey\u2019ll pop your collar as long as you play the role/I\u2019m poppin' bottles of starch/niggas know I can\u2019t fold\u201d he raps on \u201cSoft Porn,\u201d framing his commitment to keeping it real. His lyrics have always run the risk of feeling overthought, and Pieces of a Man is no exception; for all his talent, Mick sometimes verges into dorm-room thoughts (\u201ccottonmouth get you soon enough/wake up and realize the moon is us\u201d) and cringeworthy high musings (\u201cFuck is woke if you conscious but still in the bed\u201d). But his heart is in the right place, and his elevated lyrical aspirations steer him right more often than not. He interpolates a poem by Gwendolyn Brooks and raps about blockchain on the standout \u201cGwedolynn\u2019s Appreciation\u201d over a vibey, nocturnal instrumental by Detroit legend Black Milk, while on \u201cUnderstood,\u201d he rides an impeccable Kaytranada beat to show off his full power. \u201cI see the fire, I\u2019ve been drinking Freon/I\u2019m on the corner, feel like Deion/With these Cowboys, don\u2019t speak snake with these Malfoys,\u201d he spits giddily. \u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen Pieces of a Man lags, it\u2019s usually due to its production--since The Water (S), Jenkins' voice and subject matter have lent themselves to dusty, head-nodding beats that work well in isolation but derail any sense of project-length momentum. Unless you\u2019re very stoned, seventeen songs of boom-bap drums will drive even the most weathered old head crazy, and while Pieces of a Man switches things up enough to stay interesting, thanks mostly to the expert live instrumentation of THEMpeople, it's definitely the type of album that could have benefitted from an executive producer tightening screws and maintaining a sense of focus. What does keep us interested is Jenkins himself, particularly when he provides a window into the battles between his desire to be himself and his need to reach a wider audience. Several times on Pieces of a Man, his rapping reaches a frenzy, only for the vocals to simmer and the chorus to sweep in like a high tide. He\u2019s consciously censoring his neuroses--mostly with weed--in an attempt to make himself more accessible. \u201cBut I don\u2019t be trynna do the most/so I digress/I take it down/I fade to black\u2026\u201d he raps on \u201cGhost,\u201d before his voice literally fades out. \r\n\r\nOn\u00a0Pieces of a Man, we\u2019re being engaged with rather than spoken down to, sitting closely by Jenkins' side as he tries to assemble his myriad perspectives--drugged and sober, neurotic and at ease, self-righteous and vulnerable--into something cohesive. Like some of rap\u2019s best, he\u2019s a more capable spitter than he is a songwriter, but he\u2019s never really tried to be the latter. Rather, he needs \u201cpollination not your validation,\u201d or the assurance that, even when he inevitably returns to whatever hiding place he occasionally pokes his head out from,\u00a0there will still be space for him to grow.", "pptitle": ["review", "rapper", "mick", "jenkin", "elev", "freeassoci", "game", "piec", "man", "roll", "stone"]}
