But in the U.S., he hadn't drawn much notice until he began hosting Netflix's rap history series\u00a0Hip-Hop Evolution. His new album is typical of his thought-provoking work: It's a concept piece about the ways in which humanity tears itself apart through conflict, whether physical, spiritual or economic, and creates environmental catastrophe in the process. The music is airy, ambitious and typical of Aughts orchestral pop-rap; one standout number is \"The Fool (Pt. 2) (Water),\" which matches a plaintive piano melody over a soulful rhythm and a vocal hook by guest Steven Mulcare. But the focus is on Shad's words, and a plain-spoken flow that occasionally swerves into a teacher\u2019s voice and earnest spoken-word verses like \"Intro: Sniper.\" Another excellent cut is the hip-hop jazz of \"Another Year,\" where he trades rhymes about life in Toronto with Ian Kamau and Eternia.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey can\u2019t kill us \u2018cause they can\u2019t see us \u2018cause they only see fear,\u201d harmonizes Shad over the jaunty stride piano of \u201cThe Fool, Pt. 1 (Get it Got it Good).\u201d Even when he portrays a youthful \u201cSniper\u201d navigating a dystopian world that bears eerie similarities to our own, his optimism can\u2019t help but shine through. Some might find that his positive attitude undercuts his lyrical breakdown of our global system \u2013 certainly, the overwrought laptop beats of tracks like\u00a0\u201cMagic\u201d don\u2019t help. But for the rest of us, A Short Story About War is an intriguing slice of postmillennial agit-hop.", "pptitle": ["review", "shad", "stay", "posit", "amidst", "global", "chao", "stori", "war", "roll", "stone"]}
