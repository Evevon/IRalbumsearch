After the Roses had imploded, Brown turned in a defiantly lo-fi set of songs that edged out of that group\u2019s long shadow. Now that, 21 years on, the Roses have possibly wilted once again \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t be sad it\u2019s over, be happy that it happened\u201d, Brown said at their last gig, two years ago \u2013 and once again the 55-year-old has turned in an idiosyncratic set of songs laden with his personal stamp. Big producers or celebrity guest slots are shunned as King Monkey produces himself, recruits his two sons as musicians and turns to reliable influences: there are Beatles and Hollies melodies, Jimi Hendrix guitar squiggles and grooves built from funk and reggae.\nLead single First World Problems audibly echoes Primal Scream\u2019s Loaded, itself a cousin of the Rolling Stones\u2019 Sympathy for the Devil. The plaintive Breathe and Breathe Easy \u2013 delivered with just voice and acoustic guitar \u2013 could be a distant cousin of the Roses\u2019 Your Star Will Shine.\nBrown dreamily sings about \u201cthe everness of now\u201d and in similarly hazy The Dream and the Dreamer eulogises the musician-as-outsider.\n\n\n\nIf It\u2019s Raining Diamonds describes a dream of palm trees and, well, pelicans, there are fleeting but significant glimpses of Brown\u2019s political edge. He sings about \u201cbrainwashed sheep\u201d and turns Mikey Dread\u2019s Break Down the Walls (\u201c\u2026 that separate us\u201d) into a sublime anthem for these times.\nThe choice of Barrington Levy\u2019s Black Roses (rendered as a rocker) seems to be significant, but perhaps more telling are the lines in the soaring From Chaos to Harmony, where Brown asks: \u201cWhy do Roses all turn to stone? Too much poison \u2026\u201d. He concludes: \u201cI\u2019m still here, singing my song.\u201d Throughout, his oft-criticised singing is tone-perfect and balm-like. Ripples isn\u2019t a juggernaut comeback, but it\u2019s a beguiling, often beautiful album that quietly but purposefully announces his return to the fray, as ever, on his own terms.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nIan Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop and rock\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["ian", "brown", "rippl", "review", "beguil", "anthem", "return", "music", "guardian"]}
