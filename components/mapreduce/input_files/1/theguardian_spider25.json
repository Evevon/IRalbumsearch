It\u2019s reminiscent of another of these, his 2011 album Rome with composer Daniele Luppi: both are heavily influenced by Ennio Morricone\u2019s compositional style of pattering drumbeats and sweeping strings. His cinematic ambition is foregrounded in the opening title track, a nine-minute symphonic pop suite centred around a theme that is revisited on the closing Nox Lumina, and, truth be told, isn\u2019t particularly exciting. It serviceably denotes grandeur and romance but without any real melodic invention.\nWhere the album comes alive is with more traditional songwriting, anchored by Yeah Yeah Yeahs frontwoman Karen O, who co-writes throughout. Her image in the popular imagination \u2013 a makeup-smeared sex banshee \u2013 does her a disservice: she has huge emotional and textural range, something that the handsome production helps to foreground here.\nThe single Woman is the most reminiscent of the YYYs, where booming, Phil Spector-ish girl group drums power a strutting O forward, declaring her feminine agency in that signature yelp. But there are so many other sides to her here. Turn the Light clips down a hallway with a wonderful lack of haste, a disco-funk number to file alongside Natalie Prass and Kacey Musgraves\u2019 records from last year. O gets southern-accented as she relaxes, and it\u2019s songs such as this where Danger Mouse\u2019s austere yet sensual production shines: you can feel the air between every element, as well as the points where they brush against each other. Even better is Leopard\u2019s Tongue, another 60s pop curio where Danger Mouse ratchets up the beauty along with the pain by feeding in keys and then brass, and where O sketches out a complex sexual dynamic through her very voice as well as the lyrics: a seductive falsetto tightens into clenched uncertainty on the chorus. Lounge-pop numbers reminiscent of Air or early Goldfrapp aren\u2019t quite as arresting, but the whole album casts a lingering spell.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanger Mouse\n\n\n\n\nPop and rock\n\n\n\n\nElectronic music\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["karen", "o", "danger", "mous", "lux", "prima", "review", "complex", "linger", "music", "guardian"]}
