She is credited by some with writing the first Welsh symphony, and in 1949 was the first British woman to score a feature film, Blue Scar. Yet this hadn\u2019t been enough to pique much interest in her chamber music until two years ago, when Madeleine Mitchell unearthed the manuscript of her Violin Sonata. It\u2019s a punchy and piquant work, written in Vienna in 1930, when Williams was in her 20s and studying with Egon Wellesz, cultivating a European musical outlook that would stay with her, even if her chamber music sits squarely in the tradition of contemporaneous English composers such as Herbert Howells and Gordon Jacob \u2013 and, indeed, her teacher and mentor Vaughan Williams. Mitchell turned up five further unpublished chamber works \u2013 two larger in scope, three charming and skilful miniatures \u2013 all of which, like the Sonata, are recorded here for the first time.\n\n\n\nThe players of the London Chamber Ensemble make the writing sing, providing unflagging rhythmic drive, and taking care over some tricky issues of balance: both the 1931 Sextet and the 1934 Suite for Nine Instruments have a trumpet in the mix, but rather than crushing the competition it is here counterbalanced by some vibrant oboe and violin playing. Hearing these pieces back to back emphasises a sense of harmonic inertia that is more obviously present in Williams\u2019s chamber music than in her larger-scale works, but the players never let things get bogged down. It\u2019s a persuasive disc to dip into, one to spark interest in Williams\u2019s other works.\nAlso out this week\nIf there is one text that has freed up the imagination of church music composers over the centuries it is the Song of Songs. The latest disc from Ora Singers, Desires celebrates this in a luxuriant sequence of anthems spanning the beginnings of polyphony to the present day. Crisp yet sensuous music by Palestrina and Brumel rubs up against the unabashed lushness of Francis Grier\u2019s gorgeous Dilectus Meus Mihi from 1987, and there are brand new commissions by Jonathan Dove and John Barber. \n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nClassical music\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoral music\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["grace", "william", "chamber", "work", "review", "neglect", "welsh", "compos", "word", "erica", "jeal", "classic", "cd", "week", "music", "guardian"]}
