ask Little Simz. The 25-year-old rapper has released two albums and will drop her third, Grey Area, this week. There have been props from Kendrick Lamar \u2013 who once called her \u201cthe illest doing it right now\u201d \u2013 and tours with Lauryn Hill and Nas. A spot on Forbes\u2019s prestigious 30 Under 30 list. A track with Gorillaz and another that was featured on hit HBO TV show Insecure. And yet for the past nine years, Simz, AKA Simbi Ajikawo, has evaded household-name fame. Her last album, 2017\u2019s Stillness in Wonderland, was reviewed positively but didn\u2019t reach the Top 100. Her star has risen in tandem with grime\u2019s renaissance and yet that hasn\u2019t translated into the kind of accolades given to Stormzy and Skepta. You do not see her name atop festival bills like her contemporaries J Hus and AJ Tracey. \u201cThe silence surrounding Little Simz\u2019s name,\u201d said one critic, \u201chas become deafening.\u201d\nPerhaps that\u2019s because the north Londoner was always a touch ahead of her time. Born to Nigerian parents in Islington, Simz starred in various television shows and released a whopping five EPs before her first album, in 2015. That was long before Cardi B had charted with Bodak Yellow and Stefflon Don sashayed on to sold-out tours. Simz was making weird, narrative hip-hop with bold concepts (Stillness in Wonderland came with a graphic novel, an exhibition and festival) before triple-threats like Kojey Radical bounced forth, blurring the boundaries between performance artist, poet and rapper. Her tunes trilled with trumpets before the UK jazz scene properly erupted and made those sounds popular once more. (She has also, it\u2019s important to stress, remained independent throughout, self-releasing her records through her Age 101 imprint.)\nOr maybe it\u2019s because Little Simz\u2019s sound hasn\u2019t hit the right note yet. There is a lot to be said about the fight to occupy a space when your male peers are taking up all the room, especially in the bloke-heavy world of rap. Women, for the most part, have had to create new paths while their male counterparts get given a free pass down the established ones \u2013 even more so, it seems, when your image is not overtly sexualised. Simz\u2019s approach has been to explore the areas in-between \u2013 mixing up genres, being more experimental than her peers \u2013 but it has sometimes been to uncertain effect.\nAt first, her music was lumped in with grime, but in fact it cast around for other sounds: dubstep, jazz, down-tempo hip-hop, neo-soul. Reviews, including my own in 2015, suggested that while she had undeniable technical flair, Simz still had to \u201cfind her voice\u201d.\nBy which they meant, partly, that she didn\u2019t quite fit in with whatever was currently going on in music. Maybe Simz didn\u2019t break through because female MCs used to be a hard sell. Maybe it\u2019s because she wasn\u2019t grime enough for grime fans but too grime for, say, 6 Music listeners (the type that like Young Fathers). But while her last album, brave and huge in scope, was certainly incomparable to anything else at the time, it\u2019s also possible that she just needed some bigger tunes.\nOn Grey Area, those are in abundance. It swings. It grooves. It\u2019s not bogged down by a self-consciously poetic concept. And it feels like a record rather than a showcase, anchored by the production work of Simz\u2019s childhood friend Inflo. He is the Timbaland to her Missy, and gives her songs the glue they needed. Born Alex Baranowski, the producer and film composer seems to have taken notes while working with Danger Mouse on Michael Kiwanuka\u2019s 2016 album, Love & Hate (in an industry game of tag, Kiwanuka appears on Grey Area\u2019s final track, Flowers). There are big, chunky breaks, fat funk dollops, the crackle of US soul, touches of cosmic jazz and cinematic strings \u2013 also reminiscent of Adrian Younge\u2019s work with Ghostface Killah. The lead tune, 101 FM, features the best instrumental since Stormzy\u2019s Shut Up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nWatch the video for Selfish by Little Simz.\n\n\nSimz, meanwhile, has unlocked a new level of versatility. Her tracks were always soberingly serious, but here there is humour, and songs that border on the feelgood. Offence is Simz at her most Missy, deadpanning playfully bravado lines such as \u201cI\u2019m Jay-Z on a bad day, Shakespeare on my worst days\u201d over a deliciously grainy Quincy bassline. On Boss, she hollers through a megaphone like a whooping bluesman as she takes out the men who distract her.\nSimz has said in interviews that she dislikes being referred to as a \u201cfemale MC\u201d, but gender inequality has proved a fertile ground: on Venom, she spits \u201cthey don\u2019t wanna address that I\u2019m the best here for the mere fact that I\u2019ve got ovaries\u201d over taut, horror-score strings. Men, she continues, never give women credit because they \u201cdon\u2019t like pussy in power\u201d. She is not quite the voice of a generation \u2013 her tracks are too inward-looking for that \u2013 but she could be, given time. On Wounds, with a pleasing croon from Jamaica\u2019s Chronixx on the chorus, her bars survey gang crime and gun violence with a detached brilliance.\nSimz has said that making Grey Area was \u201clike therapy\u201d, after a dark spell where she questioned the isolation of trying to, as the cliche goes, make her own way. Smidgens of her struggle with alienation and questioning her career path pepper her tracks \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m so selfish,\u201d goes Cleo Sol\u2019s sweetly sung chorus on Selfish, while Flowers looks at the \u201c27 club\u201d of dead stars and wonders what the real price of fame is.\nMega-stardom might never be hers in the end, but Grey Area sets out a different kind of stall anyway: Little Simz is a slow-burner, and now that she\u2019s found a slicker sound, there\u2019s no telling where she might go.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nRap\n\n\n\n\nThe Observer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["littl", "simz", "grey", "area", "review", "rap", "maverick", "final", "find", "groov", "music", "guardian"]}
