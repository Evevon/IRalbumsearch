wonders the opening couplet of Cass McCombs\u2019 new album, Tip of the Sphere. The words were probably not intended as navel gazing. But they lend themselves well to the enigma wrapped in a wayfarer that is McCombs.\nHe has long been a hard singer-songwriter to get hold of, literally and metaphorically. Since coming gradually into renown over a period of 20 years, the native Californian has sofa-surfed and periodically worked in construction; he once painted the walls of a flat in Trump Tower. Around the release of his 2011 album, Wit\u2019s End, McCombs compounded his elusive reputation by requiring journalists to interview him by snailmail. He hung out with fellow musicians in LA, Brooklyn, Maryland, London, wherever. \u201cI\u2019m totally supported by my friends,\u201d he told an interviewer in 2013, around the time of his Big Wheel and Others album. \u201cThat\u2019s how I exist.\u201d Rostam Batmanglij, formerly of Vampire Weekend, dubbed McCombs\u2019 true-believer notoriety among other musicians \u201cthe cult of Cass\u201d.\nFor a maverick never much given to explaining his moves, his actual music is not especially forbidding. Rooted loosely in indie rock \u2013 Elliott Smith is a reference point \u2013 McCombs takes in canonic influences (Bob Dylan, Neil Young), is informed by blues, the hippie era, the Grateful Dead, psychedelics. But his lyrical output can tend to the gnomic and cosmic, even as it often has its roots in storytelling and the everyman experience. His penchant for the oblique is part of the reason this fortysomething troubadour has mooched about, just shy of the gate to the American songwriters\u2019 pantheon, for so long.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nYou lose count of the instruments puttering around unobtrusively in the background, never yelling \u2018saxophone\u2019 at you\n\n\nOf course, McCombs rewards deep listening. Tip of the Spheres is his ninth studio album of ever-expansive Americana, one where his myth properly matures. It follows the excellent showing of his 2016 expanded palette of an album, Mangy Love, in numerous end-of-year lists.\nAs before, McCombs has filled 11 tracks with a wide range of inputs, from country to ragtime to jazz; the excellent production and looming sense of space here is a marker of how far his musicality has come. One song, Real Life, turns on a dime from one mood into another; you lose count of the instruments puttering around unobtrusively in the background, never yelling \u201csaxophone\u201d at you.\nTip of the Sphere plays with place and placelessness (California, the void), with legends and shadows, \u201cauthentic fakes\u201d and \u201ccuckooland\u201d, all the while being a record you can comfortably spin in the background, until it demands your attention thanks to some unexpectedly engrossing music, or a puzzle. The final track, Rounder, is a lengthy, choogling boogie that makes you hate the Grateful Dead just a little less. Another song, American Canyon Sutra, is intoned beat poetry about a rubbish dump. It should misfire but doesn\u2019t, weaving personal recollection into \u201cthe bottomless canyon of nightmares\u201d via groovy soul.\nMcCombs\u2019 lack of interest in easy interpretations endures and, if anything, prettifies, on this engrossing record. Spheres, of course, have no tips \u2013 they are perfectly round. The album\u2019s title is likely to be a pun on the military phrase \u201cthe tip of the spear\u201d \u2013 one that refers to the first combatants into battle who pierce the enemy line so that the main body can follow \u2013 but given a celestial McCombs tilt. A few threads are graspable through McCombs\u2019 will-o\u2019 the wisp-like work. He looked askance at state-sanctioned violence towards Chelsea Manning on the song Bradley Manning (from 2012\u2019s B-sides and outtakes, A Folk Set Apart) which recounts the ballad of the WikiLeaks whistleblower\u2019s experiences at the hands of the military. It wasn\u2019t McCombs\u2019 only \u201cpolitical\u201d moment, just one of his most overt.\nMcCombs plays with language too, searching less for the humour in puns than the hidden avenues in pat phrases. Here, Sleeping Volcanoes is an easy-going tune that invites you in, before wrong-footing you. \u201cHelp me, Armageddon,\u201d runs the chorus, a plea at odds with the band playing out blithely. The entire album has an eye on the end of days; McCombs has said that the song is about \u201cpeople passing each other on the sidewalk unaware of the emotional volatility they are brushing past, like a sleeping volcano that could erupt at any moment\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nWatch a video of Cass McCombs\u2019s Sleeping Volcanoes.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all over the world,\u201d goes one recurring lyric. The initial gist of \u201call over the world\u201d is \u201cwidespread\u201d \u2013 but that changes. By the end, \u201cwe\u2019re all over the world\u201d means \u201cwe are all sick of the status quo\u201d. (\u201cWe\u2019re over it!\u201d McCombs quips, cheerily.) There follows a riff on the words \u201cworld\u201d and \u201cwar\u201d, reinforcing the song\u2019s doomy prognosis, and the idea of the slipperiness of language. \u201cUntil the next world/ The third world or the next world war/ Class war all over this world/ We\u2019re all over the world.\u201d The mellow tune carries on.\nElsewhere, McCombs\u2019 songwriting becomes more personal, then less, defying easy categorisation. Tying Up Loose Ends (\u201cbefore I gotta go\u201d) discusses family photos with burnished instrumentation taking centre stage; finality lurks in the wings. A southern rock workout, The Great Pixley Train Robbery is, by contrast, written from the perspective of a fugitive who robbed a California train in 1889, who surrenders and asks for redemption.\nThe thing is, McCombs\u2019 sphere does have a tip, of sorts. The album\u2019s beautiful artwork is based on a piece made by a California artist, Tahiti Pehrson, called Castillo de la Esfera (Castle of the Sphere); a flat rendering of a three-dimensional sphere that has been set into motion in some of the videos for these songs. As it moves, the sphere acquires a vanishing point \u2013 a tip.\nBuyers of the vinyl album, meanwhile, get a three-dimensional version to assemble and spin on their turntable. The whole thing is a tribute to Beat artist Brion Gysin\u2019s Dreamachine, a device that sought to achieve trippiness via stroboscopics, mimicking the brain\u2019s alpha waves; an online video, voiced by Robyn Hitchcock \u2013 McCombs is a massive Anglophile \u2013 instructs the user how to wig out safely to the album and the spinning castle. Gysin is just one staging point on a long road McCombs has been on for some time: exploring the margins of understanding.\nThis former skateboarder, long keen on mind-expanding substances, is no longer playing the role of wastel busker with a guitar and a piercing stare, but rather settling into a new one \u2013 that of road-wizened seeker, deep-seated musicality to the fore.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nAmericana\n\n\n\n\nThe Observer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["cass", "mccomb", "tip", "sphere", "review", "enigma", "wrap", "wayfar", "music", "guardian"]}
