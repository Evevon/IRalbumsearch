Down the front, David Bowie and \u2028Mick Jagger yelled mock insults \u2013 although no-one seemed to be paying them much attention. Order the latest issue of Uncut online and have it sent to your home!All eyes, instead, were fixed on the stage, where the band were over their allotted time and hurtling towards \u2028a frenzied finale. Unwisely, venue officials chose this exact moment to try to regain control. \u201cThey started bringing the safety curtain down,\u201d recalls pianist Morgan Fisher. \u201cBut the audience were trying to keep the show going by whatever means \u2013 jumping on stage, screaming, throwing their shirts off. I put the mockers on it by shoving the piano under the curtain. Then the other guys emerged from underneath.\u201d\u201cThe curtain stopped at the top of the piano,\u201d remembers singer and rhythm guitarist Ian Hunter. \u201cThere were three plinths over the orchestra pit, so Luther [Grosvenor, lead guitarist] and I just got up on the middle one and carried on playing. The whole place went up.\u201d\u201cEventually, the curtain came completely down and there was just Luther left out at the front, soloing away,\u201d says organist Mick Bolton. \u201cI heard his guitar splutter and howl, then it died as he was overcome \u2028by fans.\u201dAdds Fisher: \u201cIt brought everything to a head. It was \u2028a positive riot, people went mad with pure excitement.\u201dThe show \u2013 partly commemorated on 1974\u2019s Mott The Hoople Live album \u2013 wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. Mott The Hoople\u2019s story was always informed by a degree of chaos; rock\u2019n\u2019roll as raw theatre, full of swagger and rough glamour. They were the kind of band that attracted an equally devout fan base. Followers included Morrissey, Steve Jones, Mick Jones and \u2013 \u2028No 262 in Mott\u2019s official fan club \u2013 Oxford student Benazir Bhutto, later the prime minister of Pakistan. Throughout 1972, they had enjoyed the generous patronage of David Bowie.Their support act on that night at Hammersmith, \u2028and throughout their UK tour that winter, was Queen. \u201cWe\u2019d got on remarkably well,\u201d Brian May tells Uncut. \u201cIt was an incredibly exciting time.\u201dYou can read much about Mott The Hoople in the current issue of Uncut, out now with Neil Young on the cover.Subscribe to Uncut and make huge savings on the cover price \u2013 find out by clicking here!
