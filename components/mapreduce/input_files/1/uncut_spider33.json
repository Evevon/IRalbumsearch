As a female performer I understand those feelings\u201d.Discussing her decision to take a break from the album/touring schedule to write the score, she says: \u201cYou also weigh it up with \u2018OK, I\u2019ve done this half my life, do I want to continue this way? Or do I maybe want to try something different?\u2019\u2026 I think you can never lay hard lines down like that, I think you just have to go with the moment, and right now I have enormous pleasure writing scores for theatre\u201d.
