Some songs might be a full band of his buddies, others were him playing everything. These were songs he really did intend to do something with because they were carried to his typical level of production for release.\u201dAdds Christine Lakeland Cale: \u201cI wanted to find stuff that was completely unheard to max-out the \u2018Cale factor\u2019\u2026 as much that came from John\u2019s ears and fingers and his choices as I could, so I stuck to John\u2019s mixes\u2026 You can make things so sterile that you take the human feel out. But John left a lot of that human feel in. He left so much room for interpretation.\u201dCheck out the tracklisting below:    Lights Down Low\n    Chasing You\n    Winter Snow\n    Stay Around\n    Tell You \u2018Bout Her\n    Oh My My\n    My Baby Blues\n    Girl Of Mine\n    Go Downtown\n    If We Try\n    Tell Daddy\n    Wish You Were Here\n    Long About Sundown\n    Maria\n    Don\u2019t Call Me JoeSubscribe to Uncut and make huge savings on the cover price \u2013 find out by clicking here!
