Penny Rimbaud, co-founder and drummer with Crass, was meeting a sailor who had just returned from the Falklands. The sailor, a former skinhead, had written to Crass attacking the band\u2019s anarchic, anti-authoritarian politics. Steve Ignorant, Crass\u2019s vocalist, had written back in the band\u2019s spirit of engagement; they had become unlikely penfriends and allies. \u201cHe came back from the Falklands and told us everything he knew,\u201d says Rimbaud today. \u201cHe told us there \u2028had almost been a mutiny and about the HMS Sheffield, which the Navy had allowed to be destroyed. We took all that information and put \u2028it in the tape.\u201d Order the latest issue of Uncut online and have it sent to your home!But this wasn\u2019t like Crass\u2019s ferocious anti-war songs \u201cSheep Farming In The Falklands\u201d or \u201cHow Does It Feel?\u201d. Instead, Crass\u2019s bassist Pete Wright cut together speeches by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher to shape a fictitious telephone conversation between the two leaders. They sent copies to newspapers all over Europe and waited. And waited. And waited. Months later, a story appeared in The Sunday Times about the hoax in which the Pentagon claimed the KGB was responsible. Back in their shared Epping Forest house, Crass stifled giggles. But weeks later they were exposed. In January 1984, The Observer declared it was the work of \u201canarchist rock band\u201d Crass. To this day, Rimbaud still doesn\u2019t know how The Observer discovered \u2028the truth.\u201cThe tape was initially a joke,\u201d says Rimbaud. \u201cWe wanted to do anything we could to undermine Thatcher. Because of the tape, we got all this classified information about the Sheffield published on the front pages of The Observer. Suddenly we were being courted by people from all sorts of unpleasant organisations who wanted to know what else we had to offer, the KGB particularly.\u201d He pauses. \u201cTo be honest, we were shit-scared. It wasn\u2019t a joke any more.\u201dSubsequently Crass were invited to a meeting with \u201ca Russian literary magazine\u201d in Cromwell Street. Suspecting this was a KGB front, the band invited along a CBS news crew who wanted to interview them. Then, having liberally enjoyed the vodka on offer, the band scarpered, leaving Russians and Americans together. \u201cWe ran down the road like A Hard Day\u2019s Night jumping in the air and clicking our heels,\u201d says Rimbaud. \u201cNaughty little boys arsing round. But it was hellish serious. We\u2019d be shot or locked up for that now.\u201dNot many bands are involved in front page expos\u00e9s over episodes of international espionage, but not many bands were like Crass. The band were the product of a unique confluence of people, place and time, punks who lived like hippies and wrote aggressive songs about politics. They recorded five albums between 1978 and 1983 as well as a related body of films, publications and artworks and at times were less a band than \u201can information bureau\u201d, says Steve Ignorant. \u201cEverything serious or heavy that went on, we felt we had to be saying something about it.\u201dBy the time the band came apart in 1984, Crass had inspired a loyal, motivated and open-minded fanbase, many of whom wear the Crass logo as badge or tattoo and went on to campaign for animal rights, anarcho-feminism and anti-road groups. \u201cCrass touched people very deeply and people want to live their lives the Crass way,\u201d says Ignorant. \u201cAnd Crass put something in me that I can\u2019t get rid of \u2013 a conscience, a sense of injustice. I still live my life according to 99 per cent of what Crass was about.\u201dYou can read much more about Crass in the new issue of Uncut, out now with Leonard Cohen on the cover.Subscribe to Uncut and make huge savings on the cover price \u2013 find out by clicking here!Like us on Facebook to keep up to date with the latest news from Uncut.The March 2019 issue of Uncut is now on sale in the UK \u2013 with Leonard Cohen on the cover.
