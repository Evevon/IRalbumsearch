However, Simonon\u2019s personal reluctance to revisit the past meant that it never happened.Order the latest issue of Uncut online and have it sent to your home!\u201cEverybody seemed quite interested in the idea, but I wasn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d rather me and Joe worked together again in another project, rather than go the easy route and reform something that was quite special and unique to that time. It never really works, I don\u2019t think.\u201dAsked if he has any plans to commemorate the upcoming 40th anniversary of The Clash\u2019s London Calling, Simonon says: \u201cNo. I\u2019m not interested in any of that. We did do a boxset that me and Mick worked on [2013\u2019s Sound System] and as far as I was concerned that was the be all and end all, that\u2019s done. I don\u2019t think you could get any better than that. But of course the record company has this thing, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s the anniversary of this\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s like, so what? I\u2019m not interested in celebrating yesterday. I\u2019ve got other things to do. I\u2019m more interested in what you\u2019re doing tomorrow rather than what you did yesterday. That\u2019s what keeps me going, anyway.\u201dIn the wide-ranging interview, Simonon also talks about his encounter with David Bowie backstage at Shea Stadium in 1982, and reveals what it was like to record with Bob Dylan in the 80s. \u201cBob Dylan used to come to a lot of Clash shows,\u201d says Simonon. \u201cHe used to bring his family. Recording with him was\u2026 interesting. We turned up and Bob said, \u201cI\u2019ve got these ideas\u201d and he played the guitar for this song, and we\u2019re like, \u201cOK \u2013 D, E, G, F,\u201d going round it, and then he went, \u201cNow there\u2019s this other song,\u201d and then there\u2019s another song, and after about six or seven songs he says, \u201cRight, let\u2019s do the first one again.\u201d At that point, I can hardly remember the one we\u2019ve just done, let alone the first one. It\u2019s a disaster. I don\u2019t know what the point was. Maybe there was a certain energy or outlook he wanted. Nothing was explained.\u201dYou can read much more from Paul Simonon in the latest issue of Uncut, in shops now with New Order on the cover.Subscribe to Uncut and make huge savings on the cover price \u2013 find out by clicking here!Like us on Facebook to keep up to date with the latest news from Uncut.The March 2019 issue of Uncut is now on sale in the UK \u2013 with New Order on the cover.
