The first album I heard was \u2018The Head on the Door.\u2019 I hadn\u2019t heard anything like it before. I felt a lot of the darkness that I felt in my head coming back at me through the speakers, and it blew my mind.\u201cIt was like this music was written just for me. I struggled my whole life feeling that I don\u2019t fit in or belong anywhere \u2014 kind of like right now. Hearing this, suddenly I felt connected, no longer quite so alone.\u201dHe added:\u00a0\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the sound, the words, the presentation, all of it was anchored by the most\u00a0exquisite of instruments, Robert Smith\u2019s voice. That voice had such range of emotion \u2014 from rage, and sorrow and despair to beauty, frailty and joy. \u201cIt might sound na\u00efve, but until I heard The Head on the Door, I didn\u2019t realise that it\u2019s possible to have such difficult and profound ideas in the context of accessible songs that might even get played on the radio, challenging norms on the inside.\u201cTheir dedication to pushing sonic and artistic boundaries while making music for the ages wasn\u2019t always rewarded with glowing reviews in the press. But they never failed to attract a passionate, intelligent and loyal fanbase who always knew the truth: The Cure are one of the most unique, most brilliant, most heartbreakingly excellent rock bands the world has ever known.\u201dYou can watch the speech in full here:\nRecently,\u00a0Smith confirmed that The Cure have finished recording their new album.\u00a0The record, which is as-yet-untitled and has no release date, will be the band\u2019s first studio release in over 10 years and their 14th studio album.Speaking on The John Maytham Show on Cape Town radio station Cape Talk, Smith said of their recent shows: \u201cWe\u2019ve enjoyed it and we\u2019ve just recorded a new album for the first time in 10 years.\u201dHe added that he was \u201cstill doing this for the right reasons\u201d and that, while the group might cover different styles of music, but \u201cbecause it\u2019s us doing it, it sounds us.\u201dThe Cure were also\u00a0confirmed to be headlining this year\u2019s Glastonbury Festival earlier this month (March 15). They join Stormzy and The Killers at the top of a bill that also includes the likes of Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Liam Gallagher, Tame Impala, Vampire Weekend, Bastille, Billie Eilish, and more.", "pptitle": ["like", "music", "written", "just", "trent", "reznor", "pay", "emot", "tribut", "cure"]}
