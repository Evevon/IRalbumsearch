A biopic based on the anarchic career of the Sex Pistols is reportedly on the way, following the mammoth success of Bohemian Rhapsody.The 70s punk icons are thought to be the next iconic act to receive the big screen treatment \u2013 with UK firm Starlight Films working on the early stages of the biopic for the last 18 months.Filmmaker Ayesha Plunkett told the Daily Star: \u201cWe were impressed by the box office takings for Bohemian Rhapsody. It only goes to show the public has an appetite for these films.\u201dWhile the film is yet to begin shooting, the production firm says that they\u2019re about to start the casting process and have created for a wishlist for who they want to play Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren and legendary fashion designer Vivienne Westwood.The pair ran a clothes shop in the 70s in Chelsea called SEX, which proved hugely influential on punk fashion in the UK.Although McLaren and Westwood will be the focus of the film, it\u2019s believed that it will also capture the rise and fall of the notorious punk icons from 1975 to 1978.Despite being active for only three years, the Sex Pistols still remain as cultural titans \u2013 with Dr Martens recently announcing a new range of boots and shoes that have been designed in collaboration with the band\u2019s estate.In January, former Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher also describes the Pistols\u2019 debut album \u2018Never Mind The Bollocks\u2019\u2026 as the most influential record of all time.\u201cThe most influential record of all time is \u2018Never Mind The Bollocks\u2019. People who are still working now in the music business did their shit because of that record,\u201d Gallagher said.", "pptitle": ["anarchi", "big", "screen", "sex", "pistol", "biopic", "work"]}
