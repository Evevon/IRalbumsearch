Aimed at then rival Jay-Z as a direct response to his diss record \u2018Takeover\u2019, according to producer Large Professor there was an earlier version of \u2018Ether\u2019 that was produced by Swizz Beatz and featured a set of different lyrics.Talking to Vlad TV, Large Professor,\u00a0who has produced many records for Nas including three of the 10 songs on the rapper\u2019s debut album \u2018Illmatic\u2019,\u00a0remembered some of the original lines from \u2018Ether\u2019 where Nas dissed Jay by referencing Aaliyah:\u201cSorry Aaliyah/\u00a0I\u2019m sorry it was you in the plane crash/\u00a0It should\u2019ve been Jay\u2026 Dame Dash.\u201dAaliyah died in 2001 when shortly after leaving the Bahamas following a video shoot the plane she was travelling on crashed after takeoff. Aside from being good friends with Jay, she\u00a0was engaged to the Roc Nation rapper\u2019s business partner Dame Dash at the time of her death.\u201c[Nas] took the crux of the idea of that first one he did with Swizz, and then kind of did a re-edit with the Ron Browz joint,\u201d Large Professor added, after explaining\u00a0that Swizz\u2019s beat was faster and noisier than the final version.\nElsewhere in the interview, Large Professor admitted that he felt Jay-Z\u2019s \u2018Takeover\u2019 was\u00a0better musically than \u2018Ether\u2019 and used history and facts to get at Nas, whereas \u2018Ether\u2019 was purely driven by rage.Large Professor was even name-checked on \u2018Takeover\u2019 when Jay rapped: \u201cI showed you your first tec on tour with Large Professor/\u00a0Then I heard your album about your tec on the dresser.\u201dIn other news, producer Salaam Remi has released a new song that features Nas and some posthumous\u00a0Amy Winehouse\u00a0vocals.Taken from Remi\u2019s upcoming compilation \u2018Do It for the Culture 2\u2019,\u00a0Winehouse\u2019s vocals on \u2018Find My Love\u2019 were reportedly recorded during a jam session several years ago.", "pptitle": ["na", "jayz", "diss", "record", "ether", "origin", "featur", "lyric", "aaliyah", "fatal", "plane", "crash"]}
