Because today we consume so much information so quickly; I don\u2019t want to be waiting two years to put another record out.\u201dComparing the process of writing his debut to penning new songs, he added: \u201cWhat\u2019s different is the first album I had 19 years of my life to absorb all this information and put out what I thought \u2013 it was all about me. And the more and more the album got digested, the less and less it became about me \u2013 the more and more it became about us.\u201dExplaining that the new material has been inspired by his experiences of meeting fans, Yungblud told NME:\u00a0\u201cA lot of the new material\u2019s about the stories I\u2019ve heard from them, the things that they have gone through.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to release it, I can\u2019t wait. Because again, it\u2019s like me \u2013 it\u2019s just nuts. Five different genres in two minutes.\u201dDescribing the sound of his new music as \u201cstill very British\u201d with elements of hip-hop and Britpop, Yungblud also revealed that there\u2019s gospel track on LP2.\u201cI love music [and] I love taking influence from all different walks of life,\u201d he said of exploring the genre. \u201cAnd why not?
