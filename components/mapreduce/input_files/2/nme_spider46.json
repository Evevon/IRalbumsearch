The fact that we\u2019re still talking about the same stuff punks were dealing with in the 1970s means that \u2018F*** you\u2019 thing didn\u2019t work.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no authenticity in just being a prick to everyone,\u201d added Talbot.", "pptitle": ["idl", "respond", "critic", "men", "support", "lineup"]}
