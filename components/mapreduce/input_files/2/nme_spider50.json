Interpol have shared new track \u2018The Weekend\u2019 and announced the upcoming EP \u2018A Fine Mess\u2019. Check out all details along with our interview with frontman Paul Banks below.After the surprise release of the title track \u2018A Fine Mess\u2018 back in January, now the NYC trio have announced the release of a five track EP in the run-up to their packed summer festival schedule. The latest offering comes with \u2018The Weekend\u2019, another new track following on from the dark and raucous mood of 2018\u2019s acclaimed \u2018Marauder\u2018.\u201cThese are all upbeat rockers,\u201d frontman Paul Banks told NME. \u201cThey\u2019re not b-sides. They\u2019re all pretty rich rock songs with big choruses. It\u2019s all material that we can see being played in a club with people dancing. Sometimes when you turn on an Interpol record you expect people to not be dancing because it\u2019s coming from a more pensive or melancholy place. This is a place rocking EP.\u201d As for the lyrics of the EP, Banks continued:\u00a0\u201c\u2019Marauder\u2019 was a little more reflective, and this one\u2019s more about taking the party by the horns. Maybe the lyrics are a little devious and mischievous. There\u2019s no shame to that.\u201d \nDue for release on May 17, the EP was recorded during recent downtime in Upstate New York with\u00a0Dave Fridmann\u201cWe had the idea of the EP to be a separate batch of songs to be part of this whole campaign,\u201d Banks told NME. \u201cWe\u2019ve refined the material since then. It\u2019s not like \u2018Marauder songs on the EP\u2019, it was always supposed to be a separate EP and a body of work in its own right.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a good way to interact with fans these days. In hip-hop they put out mixtapes between records and it\u2019s a good method. We\u2019re engaged and active right now so it\u2019s good to double down and turn the party up a notch.\u201dSo with the band so engaged, will we hear more new material in the near future?\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to step into the world of doing a series of EPs,\u201d Banks added. \u201cI think it\u2019s more likely that the next thing we do will be a full-length record, but who can say? We don\u2019t actually have any concrete plans beyond this EP.\u201dAmong the five new songs is \u2018Real Life\u2019, which was aired on the band\u2019s \u2018Turn On The Bright Lights\u2019 15th anniversary tour back in 2017. The band have a celebrated history of renewing old rarities and releasing them, however it sounds like their isn\u2019t too much left in the vault.\u201cWe might have exhausted the stores a little at this point,\u201d Banks admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t hate the idea of putting out all the old material and cleaning out the archive to share that stuff, but I am more interested in new material.\u201dAhead of select headline shows and an appearance at Glastonbury 2019, Interpol\u2019s next major UK show will be performing at London\u2019s All Points East alongside the likes of The Strokes and The Raconteurs.\u201cWhat a line-up!\u201d said Banks of the gig. \u201cThat sounds fucking amazing. I\u2019m definitely excited to play a really, really strong rock bill. With a festival crowd, that will be great. No idea what the scene will be like. Maybe there will be backstage shenanigans? Maybe there will be a pingpong table? Holy shit. If there\u2019s an espresso machine, then I\u2019m happy.\u201dDo the band have any vices left now?\u201cI\u2019m all about the art and whatever best serves my ability to stay a happy and productive artist. That\u2019s what I partake of, and whatever that may be.\u201dInterpol perform at All Points East in London\u2019s Victoria Park on Saturday May 25.
