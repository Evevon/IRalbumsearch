The\u00a0New Orleans Advocate\u00a0reports that Louis DiVincenti \u2013 who served as a rigging grip during production \u2013 was left with 50 per cent of his body covered by third-degree burns.DiVincenti\u00a0said he was passing metal pipes down to other crew members,\u00a0before one made contact with a nearby power line. He explained that an electrical current \u201carced through his body and blew out through his right foot.\u201dWith the accident taking place during a shoot at a New Orleans restaurant,\u00a0DiVincenti\u00a0said that he then spent seven weeks in the Louisiana city\u2019s University Medical Center \u2013 where he was given a two per cent chance of survival. Despite surviving after multiple surgeries and skin grafts,\u00a0DiVincenti\u2019s\u00a0right foot had to be amputated.Now, a\u00a0lawsuit has been filed against Netflix and Motley Cr\u00fce, which claims they are liable for the accident due to a breach of health and safety precautions during production.\u201cNetflix and the producers of the movie\u00a0The Dirt, including band members Tommy Lee, Mick Mars, Vince Neil and Nikki Sixx, are liable for the production\u2019s failure to address electrical hazards near the Munch Factory restaurant in the Lower Garden District,\u201d it states.It\u2019s reported that DiVincenti is seeking damages, which include $1.8 million in medical bills.NME has contacted Netflix for comment.", "pptitle": ["dirt", "crew", "member", "sue", "netflix", "mtley", "cre", "sever", "injur", "set"]}
