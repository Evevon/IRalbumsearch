We all do\"Cardi B has further expanded on her previous claims that she used to drug and rob men who tried to pay her for sex in order to make money while she used to work as a stripper.In an Instagram Live video from three years ago, which resurfaced on social media over the weekend, the rapper is seen hitting out at her critics. As she recalls working as a stripper, Cardi revealed the desperate extremes that she went to in order to survive.\u201cN****s must\u2019ve forgot, my n***a, the shit that I did to muthafuckin\u2019 survive,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to go strip. I had to go, \u2018Oh yeah, you wanna fuck me? Yeah yeah yeah, let\u2019s go back to this hotel.\u2019\u201cAnd I drugged n****s up and I robbed them. That\u2019s what I used to do. Nothing was muthafuckin\u2019 handed to me, my n***a. Nothing!\u201dThese resurfaced comments prompted a wide backlash on social media over the weekend, and this evening (March 26) she addressed the content of the old broadcast with a post on social media, which you can see below.\u201cI never claim to be perfect or come from a perfect world wit [sic] a perfect past, I speak my truth, I always speak my own shit,\u201d she wrote, before elaborating on her view that she is part of a hip-hop culture \u201cwhere you can talk about about where you come from, talk about the wrong things you had to do to get where you are\u201d.\u201cI never glorified these things, I brought up in that live I never even put those things in my music because I\u2019m not proud of it and feel a responsibility not to glorify it.\u201cI made the choices that I did at the time because I had very limited options,\u201d she continued. \u201cI was blessed to have been able to rise from that, but so many women have not. Whether or not they were poor choice at the time, I did what I had to do to survive.\u201dAdding that the men she spoke about in the broadcast \u201cwere men that I dated, that I was involve[d] with [and] that were conscious, willing and aware,\u201d Cardi concluded: \u201cI have a past that I can\u2019t change, we all do.\u201dLast week, it was announced that Cardi had landed her first film role. She will appear in the upcoming movie Hustlers, which sees the rapper, Constance Wu, Jennifer Lopez and more tell the story of a group of strippers who scammed Wall Street workers.She also recently revealed plans to trademark her catchphrase \u2018Okurr.\u2019", "pptitle": ["cardi", "b", "clarifi", "comment", "follow", "backlash", "claim", "use", "drug", "rob", "men", "tri", "pay", "sex"]}
