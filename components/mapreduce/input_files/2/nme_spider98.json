The Jackson estate have denied any wrongdoing.When asked about the allegations, Streisand said she \u201cabsolutely\u201d believed Robson and Safechuck adding, \u201cthat was too painful.\u201dShe continued: \u201c[Jackson\u2019s] sexual needs were his sexual needs, coming from whatever childhood he has or whatever DNA he has\u2026You can say \u2018molested\u2019, but those children, as you heard them say, they were thrilled to be there. They both married and they both have children, so it didn\u2019t kill them.\u201dAsked if she was angry by Jackson\u2019s alleged actions, Streisand said: \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of feelings. I feel bad for the children. I feel bad for him. I blame, I guess, the parents, who would allow their children to sleep with him.\u201cWhy would Michael need these little children dressed like him and in the shows and dancing and the hats?\u201dThe comments received a backlash on social media from many, including the director of the documentary, Dan Reed. On Twitter, Reed wrote: \u201c\u2018It didn\u2019t kill them\u2019 @BarbaraStreisand did you really say that?!\u201dNow,\u00a0Streisand has released a statement to add clarity to the views she shared \u2013 saying she has \u201cnothing but sympathy\u201d for\u00a0Robson and Safechuck.\u201cTo be crystal clear, there is no situation or circumstance where it is OK for the innocence of children to be taken advantage of by anyone,\u201d the statement begins.\u00a0\u201cThe stories these two young men shared were painful to hear, and I feel nothing but sympathy for them.\u201dAfter previously placing the blame on the alleged victims\u2019 mothers, the singer went on to suggest that they too were manipulated by Jackson.\u201cThe single most important role of being a parent is to protect their children,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the parents of the two young men were also victimized and seduced by fame and fantasy.\u201dYou can see some of the reaction to Streisand\u2019s initial comments below:Speaking about the documentary in a recent interview with NME, the director of Leaving Neverland\u00a0alleged the musician may have \u201csexually exploited a good many more\u201d victims, saying that he thought Jackson used fame and \u201cgarish tabloid myths\u201d to his advantage in order to conceal the truth.Reed said:\u00a0\u201cMichael Jackson had unlimited power and unlimited wealth. Children looked up to him. And he exploited that to the hilt. In James\u2019 and Wade\u2019s cases, that sexual abuse lasted several years. I believe he sexually exploited a good many more little boys in his paedophile career.\u201cI think [more] will [come out], eventually, yeah. As the Michael Jackson fans say: \u2018lies run sprints, but the truth runs marathons\u2019. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening here. Sooner or later, it will come out.\u201d\u00a0Meanwhile, Streisand was announced as the latest headliner for the British Summer Time series in Hyde Park earlier this month.Streisand will headline on Sunday July 7, alongside a supporting bill of special guests that will be announced in the coming months.", "pptitle": ["barbra", "streisand", "respond", "backlash", "comment", "michael", "jackson", "abus", "alleg"]}
