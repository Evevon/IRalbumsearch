She avoided photos and interviews, maintained a low social-media profile, and let her distorted, androgynous vocals fuel the rumor mill. The tactic generated plenty of hype\u2014many wondered if the songs were a secret side project of The 1975\u2019s Matt Healy\u2014but Bain wasn\u2019t fully committed. After a few months, she ditched the gimmick and pulled back the curtain. Behind it was a soft-spoken, queer 19-year-old girl with Kurt Cobain hair and boyish style who played guitar left-handed and upside down, and who used rich, romantic production to fill out her timid voice. She was an indie ideal.\nBain offered a variety of reasons for the stunt\u2014she wanted to avoid gender classifications, she hated having her picture taken\u2014but in the end, withholding her identity made it the only thing anyone wanted to talk about. \u201cIt just became this thing,\u201d she told NME. In the years since, Bain, now 23, has kept a steady foot on the gas, releasing three more spellbinding EPs that established and expanded her sound: a mix of sumptuous synths and vocals with muted drums that sound like they\u2019ve been wrapped in felt. Each release felt bigger and brighter than the last, and marked a gradual progression from glitchy, off-kilter electro-folk (Clean) to mournful synth-pop rooted in mainstream structures (Saw You in a Dream). On her confident and intoxicating first full-length, Good at Falling, she lets go of any lingering self-consciousness and makes the transformation from hesitant outsider to unlikely pop star.\nThere are many technical reasons this spacious, unfussy record excels, but it\u2019s Bain\u2019s unrelenting heartache that lifts it from bedroom pop into something bigger. The songs are profoundly personal, detailing the tragic and tumultuous experiences that shaped her recent past: the death of her first love, the grieving that followed, the relationship that saved her (with musician Marika Hackman) and its eventual dissolution, and the ultimate realization that she\u2019ll be okay. \u201cLilo,\u201d a graceful ode to Hackman that has a perfectly floating melody, finds Bain on the other side of suffering, looking back. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder to me that I\u2019m good at falling in love,\u201d she told i-D, \u201cand I can survive falling out of it.\u201d\nHope powers the album with playful synths and vivacious rhythms, but a heavy sense of existential gloom is always looming. In a tone that\u2019s tender but frustratingly detached, Bain throws questions into the cosmos (\u201cNow tell me something/Is there a point to this?\u201d) and seems to give up before they\u2019re answered (\u201cSometimes I stop believing in things that are real,\u201d she sings, and later, \u201cAll these things don\u2019t matter/All these things don\u2019t matter\u201d). There\u2019s something about her resignation that feels at home in 2019: It\u2019s the ultimate nihilist canvas for Trump-era fatigue. Even her confession about a lukewarm relationship sounds numb and deflated: \u201cWe don\u2019t fuck anymore/But we talk all the time so it\u2019s fine,\u201d she sings. \u201cCan somebody tell me what I want? Cause I keep changing my mind.\u201d\nSuch sunken, Gen Z listlessness can get exasperating\u2014you almost want to shake her awake\u2014but it shouldn\u2019t be confused with surrender. Nobody ever said breakup records have to be confrontational. Bain\u2019s approach is more introspective and brooding; she doesn\u2019t march right up to pain so much as circle it, admiring its scrapes and bruises as though they were works of sculpture.\nMuch like avant-pop peers Robyn and Christine and the Queens, Bain uses dancefloor rhythms to loosen up her emotional muscles. But these aren\u2019t cry-in-the-club anthems, they\u2019re lullabies. With a voice so soft and low that it feels like she\u2019s whispering in your ear, she nudges you to stay home, take a breath, and get lost in the dreamy glimmer of a Mellotron.\nThe album, recorded partly at Bon Iver\u2019s Fall Creek Studio, was produced by BJ Burton (Bon Iver, Francis and the Lights) and George Daniel (the 1975), and \u201cf a r a w a y\u201d features Healy on backing vocals. It\u2019s impossible not to hear his band\u2019s influence\u2014the soaring melodies, schlocky 1980s nostalgia, and sudden bursts into stadium-sized drums or growling electric guitar. Bain attributes this largesse to playing bigger shows; after Healy signed her to his home label, Dirty Hit, he invited her on their arena tours as the opening act. Still, even with huge, lush arrangements and a growing toolkit of instruments, the songs never sound cluttered or overwrought. \u201cFollow My Girl,\u201d an ethereal yet pummeling song about forgetting what it feels like to feel good, blurs synths and vocals together like light trails in a nighttime photograph.\nBain is not a powerhouse singer, and she often beefs up her vocals with Auto-Tune or thick harmonic layers. But on \u201cSaw You in a Dream,\u201d a stripped-back version of the previously released single, she peels off the flotation devices and jumps in. A strummy, surfy tribute to her late first love, the track was recorded in two teary takes. Her voice quivers and cracks along as she wrestles with conflicting feelings of agony and acceptance. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the same but it is enough,\u201d she sings, the perfect epilogue to a project about life after grief.\n", "pptitle": ["good", "fall"]}
