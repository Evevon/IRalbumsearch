The Canadian musician presented her master\u2019s thesis about the effects of certain chemicals on an endangered West Coast orca species last year, and she recently started a talk series featuring young scientists. As Jayda G, she\u2019s been responsible for some of the most rapturous disco house to come out of the \u201cCanadian Riviera\u201d scene, and she has captivated crowds worldwide with her uninhibited DJ style. Let other selectors squabble about sharing track IDs and unwarranted wheel-ups\u2014she\u2019d rather concentrate on providing the soundtrack for cathartic, electronic device-free boogieing.\nFollowing a string of excellent EPs and singles on labels including 1080p, Geography Records, and her own JMG Recordings, Significant Changes is the Berlin-based producer\u2019s debut album. Like much of Guy\u2019s previous work, the nine tracks here draw on influences including Chicago house, soul, disco, and 1990s R&B, but her references to the natural world this time around are more overt. Recorded while she was finishing her studies, its bookending intro (\u201cUnifying the Center (Abstract)\u201d) and outro (\u201cConclusion\u201d) read like parts of a scientific paper; it\u2019s not surprising that there\u2019s a sense of ecological urgency underpinning many of these songs.\nIn interviews, Guy has frequently expressed her desire to bridge her two passions, and one way she achieves this is by turning field recordings into unexpectedly poignant melodies. The instrumental centerpiece \u201cOrca\u2019s Reprise\u201d is built around the marine mammals\u2019 cries, but the producer smartly avoids new-age chintziness. \u201cMissy Knows What\u2019s Up\u201d takes the concept one step further, sampling the ominous words of Canadian biologist Misty MacDuffee (\u201cWhy are these whales threatened and what are we going to do about it?\u201d), and setting them to a thumping backbone.\nIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom, however, and Guy expertly balances the record\u2019s more somber offerings with a handful of four-on-the-floor, heat-seeking anthems. If you\u2019ve seen her play at a festival or listened to one of her decade-hopping radio mixes, then you know that, as a DJ, she prioritizes songs that exude a certain timelessness, rather than trying to score cool points for obscurity. From War\u2019s 1971 funk hit \u201cSlippin\u2019 Into Darkness\u201d to TLC\u2019s \u201cCreep,\u201d she\u2019s constantly thinking about what will elicit the biggest head-bobbing, limb-pumping responses from her audiences. Frequent collaborator Alexa Dash appears on two euphoric tracks, \u201cSunshine in the Valley\u201d and \u201cLeave Room 2 Breathe,\u201d and her soulful, husky croon perfectly complements Guy\u2019s shuffling grooves, vintage drum-machine sounds, and, on the latter, roller-rink cowbell.\nYet on an album that\u2019s full of human and animal voices alike, the most prominent one is her own. Guy\u2019s arresting spoken-word vocals take center stage on \u201cStanley\u2019s Get Down (No Parking on the DF)\u201d and \u201cMove to the Front (Disco Mix),\u201d both of which address dancefloor etiquette over propulsive basslines and warm strings. \u201cI see you with your phone looking at Instagram,\u201d she playfully admonishes on the former, while the latter is a rousing call to arms to ladies \u201call the way in the back,\u201d which sees the producer doing her best Body Break host impression. As if to remind listeners that it\u2019s not so serious, she punctuates these instructions with gleeful whoops.\nAccording to Guy, the album\u2019s title has a twofold meaning. Not only was it the most-used phrase in her thesis, but it also refers to the personal and artistic changes she\u2019s experienced in recent years, as she\u2019s moved halfway across the world and played shows even further afield. Her ever-growing platform to reach people, she says, brings certain responsibilities, whether it\u2019s reducing her carbon footprint or helping create more diverse and inclusive learning and dancing spaces. Like all the best teachers, she\u2019s leading by example.\n", "pptitle": ["signific", "chang"]}
