\u201cvisualizer\u201d accompanying his career-high mixtape Hi This Is Flume, the Australian electronic producer drives a car decorated in kaleidoscopic metal panels, like something that the pastel-obsessed pop artist Bridget Riley might create for MTV\u2019s \u201cPimp My Ride.\u201d When the vehicle needs refueling, he cracks open a can of La Croix and dumps it into the gas tank. The appearance of the mildly flavored, urbanite-favored seltzer here is clearly meant to be at least partly tongue in cheek. But there\u2019s something fitting about it, too: Of course Flume would drink La Croix.\nDespite his work with inventive artists like Vince Staples and Lorde (and a Grammy to his name), Harley Streten\u2019s music as Flume has often felt like bait for audiences who have moved on from the soft-focus EDM of the influential YouTube channel Majestic Casual but still prefer to keep their listening lite. His mega-popular pillowy bangers are engineered for broad appeal, often possessing the \u201csoft, emo-y, cutesy\u201d simplicity that one streaming-first producer, speaking anonymously to Liz Pelly in The Baffler, recognized as playlisting catnip.\nHi This Is Flume is set up to self-consciously dismantle the view of Streten as making music optimized for the algorithm. The mixtape\u2019s title has a pointed sense of re-introduction, like the pop superstar who indicates, with a self-titled album years into an established career, that she is pushing the reset button. One song, the bright, chime-strewn \u201cEcdysis,\u201d is even named after the process of a snake shedding its epidermis. (Streten\u2019s previous full-length was titled Skin, geddit?) Underscoring this message is Hi This Is Flume\u2019s opening title track, a spoken-word novelty which parodies streaming platform commercials. \u201cTap the artwork to listen and save to your own music collection,\u201d Streten says with satirical faux-buoyancy. Then he screams.\nHi This Is Flume is, both philosophically and sonically, an inflection point. Seventeen cohesive tracks nudge the needle on Streten\u2019s sound, with frequent jump cuts from dismantled clubby beats to pogo-inducing drops and thick bass, while generally keeping his gifts for emotive melodies in the foreground. The bulk of the mixtape\u2019s tracks circle the two-minute mark, giving the sense of a sketched roadmap to a new outlook (Streten has already promised \u201cmore music to come\u201d). \u201cDreamtime,\u201d a vortex of white noise with feathery vocal effects, could soundtrack a Coachella documentary filmed by David Lynch, while the synths of \u201cJewel\u201d take on an uncanny vocaloid quality, a little like the melodic manipulations of Battles\u2019 \u201cAtlas.\u201d At other times, a certain scrappiness would be welcome: less airtight momentum, more negative space. \u201cWormhole,\u201d for all its Call of Duty lock-and-load effects, never quite feels sinister, and the siren-like textures of \u201cDaze 22.00\u201d aren\u2019t as trippy as the title promises. Hi This Is Flume\u2019s fragment-like moments might take on more dynamic and emotive tension if Streten allowed himself more complex arrangements, or track lengths with more room to maneuver.\nIn her review of Flume\u2019s Skin, Stacey Anderson noted a \u201cmathematical quality\u201d in the way Streten treated the vocals of his guest singers, most of them women. Happily, Hi This Is Flume snuffs out that habit, adopting a more sparing and even-handed approach to collaboration. Just four songs feature guest vocalists, and one of those is a remix. The SOPHIE co-production \u201cVoices\u201d is a Gregorian-chant-led melodrama, reminiscent in part of Fatima Al Qadiri\u2019s experiments with religious music, with a yearning Ku\u010dka hook that\u2019s shredded and slapped with latex. SOPHIE\u2019s idiosyncratic style seems to have had a more holistic effect on Hi This Is Flume, too\u2014and not just in Flume and San Francisco producer Eprom\u2019s superfluously amped-up \u201cIs It Cold in the Water?\u201d remix. The stepped-on balloon squeaks and soda-can hiss of \u201cAmber\u201d also call to mind SOPHIE\u2019s earliest music, offering further evidence of Streten\u2019s ear turning toward pop\u2019s relative fringes.\nSpeaking to Zane Lowe last year, Streten detailed his technique when working with rappers, one that involved overhauling the beat after they lay down their verses \u201cso the whole piece of music fits the vocal like a glove.\u201d He hasn\u2019t always made good on that, given previous disjointed tracks with Vic Mensa and Pusha T. Refreshingly, Hi This Is Flume\u2019s two collaborations in this vein, both highlights, flow much more naturally. \u201cHigh Beams,\u201d a co-production with Perth-born HWLS, pairs Slowthai\u2019s livestreamed-from-hell punchlines with thudding bass and jostling clusters of synths. And the hydraulic bounce of \u201cHow to Build a Relationship\u201d ricochets from menacing low end to ray-gun zaps around JPEGMAFIA\u2019s riotous quotables.\nMany artists have an anecdote that they are forced to regurgitate in every interview. For Streten, it\u2019s the story of how he started making music after downloading a \u201cgimmicky,\u201d loop-based music program from a giveaway in a Nutri-Grain cereal box. \u201cThe whole concept of how music was laid out in layers [...] but came out as one piece of music was really intriguing for me,\u201d he has said. The most vivid takeaway from Hi This Is Flume is how he breaks apart his now-familiar sound, zooming in on the different layers and looking at them in new ways. He has taken his music a long way from the safety of the cereal box. It will be fascinating to see how far he is willing to push it.\n", "pptitle": ["hi", "flume"]}
