The Punjabi-Canadian MC made the decision out of solidarity with his buddy Lil Uzi Vert, a far superior talent who had recently declared that he was \u201cdone with music.\u201d In hindsight the move was predictable; Nav has always been a creature of imitation, cribbing the styles of his various peers to far less interesting results, whether it\u2019s Travis Scott\u2019s Auto-Tuned croons or fellow Torontonian Drake\u2019s minimal production. He\u2019s the artistic equivalent of the \u201cI Made This\u201d meme, only the sketched character throws up on the invention in the third slide, ruining what made it special in the first place. Bad Habits, his so-called comeback album, is more of the same, a hollow and magic-free entry into the trap-rap canon. At its best, its songs are serviceable bangers to nod off in the club to; at its worst, it\u2019s a collection of strange admissions that, thanks to Nav\u2019s affinity for taking himself too seriously, come off cringe-worthy.\nThe lone highlight of the project comes early on the chorus for \u201cI\u2019m Ready,\u201d where Nav for once finds himself in the melodic pocket, humming about his congested chest from smoking too many Backwoods and leaving someone facedown in a plate of spaghetti after pulling a mob-style hit. It\u2019s a ridiculous visual, but shows Nav making the most out of his limited vocal range, his nasally thrum coming off almost endearing in its frailty. Things go straight downhill from there, though. On the very next track, \u201cTaking Chances,\u201d Nav is back to dropping clunker boasts like, \u201cRockin' my closet, I can't tell you my favorite, I got plenty of clothes.\u201d The chorus is even worse: \u201cI don\u2019t like taking chances/I like fucking hoes I already know,\u201d he declares.\nThis paranoia shows up constantly on Bad Habits. Nav tells us constantly that he doesn\u2019t trust anyone outside his circle, that he never leaves home without a weapon. It\u2019s impossible to take this kiddie-pool Scarface routine seriously when his paranoid delusions are followed up by giggling admissions like \u201cGot a little bad bitch/Got some work done on her butt (On her butt).\u201d (Meek Mill, who\u2019s featured on the track, takes Nav\u2019s cue and one-ups him by rapping, \u201cPut my thumb all in her A-hole.\u201d)\nIt\u2019s a contrasting dynamic made more taxing by the fact that Nav doesn\u2019t lean into his weirdness nearly enough, something he could learn a thing or two about from Atlanta oddity Young Thug, who appears here on the song \u201cTussin.\u201d Rather than highlight his own eccentricities, Nav\u2019s songwriting is based in sinister tough talk, which doesn\u2019t suit him and is boring to boot. By the time The Weeknd appears on \u201cPrice On My Head,\u201d singing about, well, prices on people\u2019s heads, you\u2019re completely burned out. Combine this with painfully repetitive production\u2014the drum patterns on two consecutive tracks, \u201cDior Runners\u201d and \u201cVicodin,\u201d are virtually identical\u2014and that Bad Habits includes more blatant misogyny and homophobia than any project in recent memory (\u201cShe said you're such a fuckboy that you made her turn dyke,\u201d is one particularly memorable blurt of ignorance) and you start to pine for a simpler time, only a few weeks ago, when Nav had supposedly put down the mic for good.\n", "pptitle": ["bad", "habit"]}
