where Garcia and the Grateful Dead lingered on both the singles and albums charts. The MTV-assisted hit \u201cTouch of Grey\u201d peaked at No.9, while parent album In the Dark climbed to No. 6\u2014the only two Top 10 hits of the Dead\u2019s career. Another way to find Garcia that same weekend was to pack the car and drive three-and-a-half hours north of San Francisco, deep into the Emerald Triangle, northern California\u2019s much-contested cannabis-growing region, until Route 101 ran along the Eel River. There, at a secluded spot known as French\u2019s Camp, Jerry Garcia and his long-running Jerry Garcia Band jammed on a simple tapestry-draped stage while naked hippies frolicked in the water, a benefit for Wavy Gravy\u2019s Camp Winnarainbow.\nA new box set, Electric on the Eel, captures the Jerry Garcia Band on their three visits to the idyllic French\u2019s Camp in 1987, 1989, and 1991. They show Jerry Garcia at both the height of his fame and simultaneously escaping into his not-so-secret identity: himself. Since 1970, Garcia had played outside the Dead in various musical guises, hiding in plain sight at regular no-name jam sessions in Bay Area clubs that\u2014with bassist John Kahn\u2014consolidated into the Jerry Garcia Band by 1975. Though the Garcia Band would remain most at home playing in dark bars, they also became an outlet for the kind of laid-back musical opportunities the Dead could no longer accommodate, like playing for a few thousand hippies in the summer sunshine while Wavy Gravy MCed.\nIn more ways than one, The Jerry Garcia Band functioned as an escape hatch from the creative and financial chaos of the Grateful Dead\u2014Kahn, Garcia\u2019s frequent musical second-in-command outside the Dead, also served as Garcia\u2019s longtime drug buddy. In the summer of 1986, Garcia fell into a diabetic coma and nearly died. Years of addiction and ill health had taken their toll, and when he came to, he had to relearn how to play guitar. When he took the stage again, in decent health for the first time in nearly a decade, he had a new sense of agency and purpose. You can hear that ravaged clarity even in these low-key sessions.\nAs Electric on the Eel documents, the Jerry Garcia Band was as unpretentious as the Grateful Dead were convoluted. With the repertoire of a deep bar act, they were a platform for Garcia\u2019s endless guitar variations over a more straightforward rhythm section, plus backup singers to support Garcia\u2019s scarred voice. It is uncomplicated and often sweet, lying at the blurry intersection of rock, R&B, Motown, and gospel, cushioned by the enveloping warmth of Melvin Seals\u2019 Hammond organ and Gloria Jones and Jacklyn LaBranch\u2019s backing vocals. It is music intended for dancing or, at least, feeling good.\nThe box set dips into Garcia\u2019s bag of trusted extra-Dead originals, including 1982\u2019s charging \u201cRun For the Roses,\u201d 1976\u2019s redemptive \u201cMission in the Rain,\u201d and 1977\u2019s apocalyptic \u201cGomorrah.\u201d But most of Electric on the Eel is devoted to a songbook of covers in the emerging jam-band vernacular that Garcia was helping to define. Among the 31 different songs on Electric on the Eel, more than a dozen were new to the songbook since Garcia\u2019s coma, including Bruce Cockburn\u2019s \u201cWaiting For A Miracle,\u201d which became a late-career staple, and \u201cTwilight,\u201d a pining and lonesome deep cut by The Band. Garcia\u2019s voice is especially strong and confident on crisp versions of Los Lobos\u2019s \u201cEvangeline\u201d from 1987 and 1989, neither version cracking four minutes, both bouncing like the streamlined early \u201870s Dead.\nGarcia\u2019s vocals, despite ample wear and tear, are in arguably the best shape of his later years. Nearly every track is a sterling example of how someone with a damaged voice can also be an incredible singer. Scratched from years of cigarettes and freebasing Persian heroin, Garcia\u2019s voice flutters and shakes. He doesn\u2019t always sustain notes or land on the right pitch. Sometimes, he transposes verses or forgets lyrics. And yet, his singing is as much a reason to listen to Electric on the Eel as his guitar playing, both filled with a rejuvenating brightness mirrored in Melvin Seals\u2019 buoyant organ, and capable of clarity, articulation, and even power. Garcia had been singing spirituals since his folkie days in the early \u201860s, but\u2014in its post-coma return\u2014his voice finds more grace than ever.\nOf course, every track makes its way to the inevitable guitar solo. \u201cI\u2019ll take a simple C to G and feel brand new about it,\u201d Garcia sings on a cover of Allen Toussaint\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Take a Melody,\u201d perhaps a rare bit of boasting on Garcia\u2019s part. A staple of his solo shows since the early \u201970s, it\u2019s also a song that became his own, in part through his brilliant variations on it. To those tuned in, Garcia\u2019s guitar could unlock the language of the cosmos even on generic bar fodder like Eric Clapton\u2019s \u201cLay Down Sally.\u201d  When Garcia was tuned out, though, as he was for much of the early \u201880s, it could also sound closer to a musical screensaver. By 1987, Garcia\u2019s playing and singing had both regained their former urgency, the cosmos once again within reach.\nCompared to the languid Garcia Band extravaganzas of the \u201970s, the Electric on the Eel shows are fairly concise. There is one excellent exploratory jam\u2014a 14-minute \u201cDon\u2019t Let Go\u201d from 1989\u2014but most performances fall under the 10-minute mark. Anchored by drummer David Kemper, who once described the band\u2019s particular groove as simultaneously \u201chaving the foot on the gas pedal and foot on the brakes,\u201d the band is flexible and easy, sliding with Garcia as his improvisations stretch.\nMost of the music on Electric on the Eel has only circulated as fan-made audience tapes, so these recordings will provide upgrades for deeper heads. But the scope of the set is also a fine way for the Jerry-curious to take a deeper dive into what many consider to be the Garcia Band\u2019s golden period. For some Deadheads, as for Jerry Garcia himself, the Jerry Garcia Band became their own escape from the Dead, and Electric on the Eel shows why, moving with a lightness the Dead had long since lost. Its six discs are both a comprehensive document of the group\u2019s penultimate lineup and a fine introduction to the Jerry Garcia Band at their best, music to make the hassles disappear.\n", "pptitle": ["electr", "eel"]}
