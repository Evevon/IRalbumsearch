She did this first under a gang of pseudonyms, often on her pioneering labels Rainbow Bridge and Swamp Circle, but hit a bullseye with Fire-Toolz, a potent cocktail of dazed Muzak, noise, and happy hardcore spiced with the occasional hissed black-metal vocal. After refining that project with two albums on Hausu Mountain, another Chicago haven for the weird and wonderful, Marcloid returns as Nonlocal Forecast with Bubble Universe!, a new project inverting Fire-Toolz\u2019s crackling aggression with the help of aquatic new-age synths, smooth jazz, and prog rock.\nAs Fire-Toolz, Marcloid made her knack for impossible genre combinations feel like a rollercoaster, but Nonlocal Forecast subtly accomplishes a harder task. It flies through ideas but builds track by track with purposeful progression, and it only gets better once the initial thrills wear off and you learn its trajectory. With Bubble Universe!, Marcloid spreads her ideas out like a rainbow, encapsulating everything in a seamless spectrum from hot to cool. It\u2019s a perfect introduction to what already feels like her best project.\nBubble Universe! explodes with gleefully clashing ideas from the start, opening with dramatic synth flourishes and dizzying drum patterns on \u201cCelestial Nervous System,\u201d a tightrope walk between jazzy prog and proggy jazz. Though Marcloid is programming drums on a computer rather than playing live, her background as a prog-rock drummer translates to fills that feel both spontaneous and mathematically dazzling. The result hijacks the soothing soundtrack of the Weather Channel and charges it with metal\u2019s cathartic energy, a combination that only grows on the following \u201cPlanck Lengths,\u201d which echoes the ornate MIDI symphonies of James Ferraro\u2019s vaporwave blueprint Far Side Virtual before a sprawling drum solo takes it to light speed.\nBy the third song, the brightly emotive burst of \u201cCloud-Hidden,\u201d Bubble Universe! has crystallized this sound so fully that it feels natural when Marcloid largely leaves it behind for the rest of the album. \u201cThe Direct Path\u201d slams the brakes with a spacious synth melody and a luxurious guitar solo that only grows softer and sweeter as it lands on delicate percussion far removed from the opening tracks\u2019 energy. On \u201cTriangle Format,\u201d Marcloid\u2019s Fire-Toolz moniker makes a featured appearance, but here she eschews that project\u2019s metal vocals in favor of a rush of synths and distant coos that carry Nonlocal Forecast into its contrasting second half.\nDrifting further from the metal influences sparking the album\u2019s early tracks, \u201cThe Evolutionary Game\u201d and \u201cClassical Information\u201d shine like some of the most distinct video-game music of the 1990s. The former rides a simple 4/4 beat with twinkling synths and a middle section that nods to David Wise\u2019s naturalistic soundscapes in Donkey Kong Country, while the latter\u2019s jazzy MIDI lines and funky bass synths create a kind of synesthestic accompaniment for imaginary Sonic the Hedgehog levels. It all leads to a closing trio of tracks as soothing and ambient as the beginning was kinetic. They make a powerful bookend for Bubble Universe!\u2019s impressive range and focus, as well as a welcome invitation to hit replay and start the game all over again.\n", "pptitle": ["bubbl", "univers"]}
