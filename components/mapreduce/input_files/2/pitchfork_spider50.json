Her first single, \u201cDon\u2019t Kill My Vibe,\u201d was released in February 2017, and established her as a pop iconoclast: the young woman who (at least according to her oft-told story) left a session with patronizing older male writers to write her own song about how out of touch they were. Her vibe, going by her first single, was a mix of earthiness\u2014the rasped vocals shown off in the relatively naked verses\u2014and machine-honed Scandinavian pop bombast. Since then, it has not been killed so much as flogged by a stream of Spotify bait cut from the same cloth: Island have thrown so many singles at the wall that three from last year aren\u2019t even on Sucker Punch.\nHers is one of the most assiduous campaigns in contemporary pop, and yet everything about the PR push insists that Sigrid is not like the other pop stars. She doesn\u2019t wear make-up. She doesn\u2019t do features. She\u2014let me check the notes\u2014got her favorite T-shirt free from a Dutch airline, and she just wants to be free to be herself. In this sense, the 22-year-old Norwegian is exactly like the other pop stars, selling a version of authenticity that is just as constructed as a 63-foot inflatable snake or a dude wearing a giant marshmallow head. It\u2019s \u201crealness\u201d as a shortcut to relatability, a two-dimensional affect that her slick debut album does little to flesh out.\nSigrid includes two songs on Sucker Punch that directly address the music industry\u2019s attempts to manipulate her. Alongside \u201cDon\u2019t Kill My Vibe,\u201d which sets the album\u2019s tone of synth-battalion sweetness, there is \u201cBusiness Dinners,\u201d its slightest and most appealing song. It's a faded tropical postcard decorated with geometric Memphis Group squiggles; SOPHIE kicking back and sipping a pi\u00f1a colada. Lilting and off-kilter, it extracts the essence of Sigrid\u2019s message as if by IV drip: The industry wants her to be \u201csweeter, better, angel,\u201d \u201cpictures, numbers, figures/Yeah, deeper, smarter,\u201d an astute summary of the contradictions facing young female artists that she kisses off impeccably. \u201cStanding on the shoreline/I just wanna swim and float,\u201d she sings idly, and for a second you\u2019re there with her, watching her long brown hair ripple in the waves. Then those fateful words re-emerge: \u201cAnd I\u2019m just trying to be me.\u201d\nIf Sucker Punch contained more songs this endearingly weird and casually incisive, there would be a case for Sigrid\u2019s individuality. \u201cStrangers\u201d improves on the \u201cDon\u2019t Kill My Vibe\u201d template, using tiny percussive snags and an icy synth glow in the verses to create an air of genuine desolation. Then it ramps up, via a smartly deployed EDM riser, into a belting chorus that inverts everything that came before: the feverish synth arpeggiations packed tight, her optimism about her poetic attraction to a stranger flipped to cold, hard realism (\u201cWe\u2019re falling head over heels for something that ain\u2019t real\u201d). Nearly every other song repeats the formula less effectively, save the piano ballads, which feel more like \u201cWriter in the Dark About How to Write \u2018Writer in the Dark.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cStrangers\u201d is the best bit of writing amid some underdeveloped concepts: \u201cBasic\u201d\u2014as in, \u201cI wanna be basic/\u2018Cause you make me so complicated\u201d\u2014is shameless start-from-the-hashtag songwriting that really does sound focus-grouped by old men. \u201cSucker Punch\u201d attempts to set a scene\u2014a hallway rendezvous, coffee by the stairs, matching red hoodies\u2014which it quickly forgets as it heaves into a triumphant major-key chorus eerily reminiscent of Natasha Bedingfield\u2019s \u201cUnwritten.\u201d Equally chipper is \u201cMine Right Now,\u201d which sounds, of all things, like Billy Ocean\u2019s \u201cWhen the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Feel Like Crying\u201d and \u201cSight of You\u201d start with the kind of jaunty, slashing string sections that introduce Eurovision competitors.\nThere is potential in Sigrid\u2019s optimistic sound. \u201cDon\u2019t Feel Like Crying\u201d is almost obscenely chipper: If it wasn\u2019t for the odd swear word, it could easily pass for Kidz Bop. But its brightness is blinding, almost painful, suggesting the sheer effort required to avoid wallowing post-breakup. To Sigrid and her cowriters\u2019 credit, Sucker Punch remains dedicated to this primary-color production scheme, which dazzles in contrast to contemporary pop's nihilistic grey. But its formulaic songs lack the free-spirited personality that telegraphed her early promise. The story of a young female songwriter  pushing back against the sexist songwriters on her major label and modern pop\u2019s oppressive beauty standards is an impressive one. The cautious Sucker Punch could do with more of that insurrectionist spirit.\n", "pptitle": ["sucker", "punch"]}
