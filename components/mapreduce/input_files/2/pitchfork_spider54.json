It was evident on Low Life\u2019s debut 2014 album Dogging\u2014the lyrics from the band\u2019s burly and brooding post-punk songs owe quite a bit to Australian lad culture. Tolman\u2019s got a gift for turning entitled toxic masculine bullshit into absurdist satire. \u201cTryin\u2019 to be a good man, to be a good bloke/But I love gettin\u2019 off and I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 stoked,\u201d he deadpanned on Dogging ripper \u201cDNA.\u201d In the field of recent post-punk bands, Low Life occupy a deeply specific zone. They make muscular pit music that glistens with new wave synthesizers, and meanwhile, a dispassionate Australian voice is up front taking the piss out of sexist and homophobic dinguses. It\u2019s a riveting mixture.\nOn their second album Downer Edn (pronounced \u201cDowner Edition\u201d), Low Life continue to comb through society\u2019s sludge. Tolman still puts together elaborate depictions of dirtbags, like his portrait of the titular \u201cWarrior\u201d\u2014a \u201cgolden orange tan\u201d dude who eats KFC while watching UFC. Those kinds of details are good for a laugh or two, but Tolman\u2019s stiff delivery and his bandmates\u2019 brusque gang vocals highlight the darkness behind this caricature of strongman politics and domestic violence. Their song \u201c92,\u201d which alludes to child abuse, peers even further into the void. \u201cSmall boys grow into bad men, battered boys become very bad men\u201d is the song\u2019s horrific mantra.\nWhile Downer Edn bursts with punk vitality\u2014fuzz, volume, speed, a bunch of dudes shouting in unison\u2014it\u2019s their work with feedback and texture that makes it special. Beyond the clipped churn of power chords on \u201cLad Life,\u201d a shimmering, gauzy guitar tone presides. It\u2019s a sweet-and-salty combination that\u2019s been in place since Dogging, but the new album finds the band sounding more streamlined and sophisticated than ever. It\u2019s tempting to credit their new collaborators for the upgrade, namely co-producer Mickey Grossman and new guitarist and synth player Dizzy Daldal. Daldal is also a member of Orion, a Sydney band whose overlooked self-titled 2017 album was a sparkling document of Factory Records-indebted post-punk.\nIt\u2019s not just dreamy guitars or bleak humor that elevate Downer Edn: They\u2019ve also got a bona fide anthem in \u201cRBB.\u201d The title is an abbreviation for the Red and Black Bloc, the official fan group for the Western Sydney Wanderers Football Club. (Tolman is an outspoken soccer fan.) Drummer Greg Alfaro builds momentum for their mission statement: \u201cYou know who the fuck we are/We are Western Sydney,\u201d they chant. It doesn\u2019t matter where in the world you are\u2014if Low Life are in your town, you\u2019re probably going to scream the band\u2019s Sydney soccer anthem back at them. Hell, it even happened at a recent Melbourne show.\nIn an interview, Low Life discussed the guiding question behind their creative process: \u201cWhat can we do easiest that can work the best?\u201d Downer Edn is an album-length expression of that philosophy,  with an emphasis on repetition and subdued vocals. Sometimes it works and they pull off a major coup (\u201cRBB\u201d), and elsewhere, songs are prone to going stale or petering out (\u201cRave Slave\u201d). They\u2019ve put together a record that\u2019s consistently captivating. There\u2019s darkness and there are laughs, scream-along anthems for shoving and dreamy near-ballads. The first and last song on the album are variations on the same melody, so as album closer \u201cCrash\u201d ends, it feels effortless to flip the record and revisit \u201cThe Pitts.\u201d It\u2019s a tongue-in-cheek song where they essentially declare that you, the listener, are now their disciple. It\u2019s a self-aware joke, but maybe wait to laugh until you\u2019ve stopped running the album back.\n", "pptitle": ["downer", "edn"]}
