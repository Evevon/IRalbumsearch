Four albums in, they are firmly devoted to keeping that space both weird and uncomfortable. High Anxiety doesn\u2019t stray from their aesthetic: it\u2019s thrashy if not entirely thrash, it\u2019s dirty and smeared at the edges, and they remain sick of your shit, with their definition of \u201cyour shit\u201d an exponentially expanding, spiteful blob. Even without changing much, they\u2019re still the freaks underground metal needs.\nWhether or not you can understand any of Zack Weil\u2019s shrieks in the opener \u201cSurrounded by Fucking Idiots,\u201d the bile in his guitar is easily understandable. They\u2019re not interested in metaphors or dressing up their hatred in Latin and sigils. The second half of \u201cIdiots\u201d lurches into swampy riffing, a mutated take on a thrash breakdown. It\u2019s more for throwing a bunch of aforementioned idiots off a cliff than for stage-diving, offering no release but annihilation. \u201cTween Shitbag\u201d is equally incendiary, with Weil sarcastically yelling \u201cOh man I really love your band!\u201d, a call back to the anti-industry screed \u201cNew York Bands\u201d from their debut Retrash.\nHigh Anxiety also recalls Voivod on \u201cDie on Mars\u201d and \u201cRiding the Universe,\u201d not just for their space themes but also how punky thrash and prog goofiness chop it up with one another. \u201cMars\u201d throws some death metal in the mix, the intro guitar leads sounding like Bolt Thrower solos drifting into a trash-filled outer space. These songs are house shows as terrariums populated by metal dudes too strange for the pay-to-play clubs and punks who punish themselves in Ph.D. programs, and Oozing Wound makes the chaos coalesce. They\u2019re serious, but not serious.\nOozing Wound have always been indebted to Midwestern noise rock like Wolf Eyes and Destroy All Monsters as much as weird thrash \u2014 their slogan \u201cthe world\u2019s fastest noise rock band\u201d passes muster. The most noise rock moment on High Anxiety is actually the longest and slowest song: \u201cBirth of Flat Earther\u201d plods and drags like AmRep at its most high-gain and high-strung, with no blast beats to energize the grim proceedings. \u201cEarther\u201d also hints at weariness that looms over High Anxiety: they\u2019re still dishing out hate, but it\u2019s starting to get to them. The record was almost called I Know It\u2019s Only Rock and Roll but I\u2019m Tired of It, a longer yet less opaque title. If you were surrounded by fucking idiots all day, you would be exhausted, too.\n", "pptitle": ["high", "anxieti"]}
