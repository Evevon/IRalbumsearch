Even in his own music, he is best enjoyed as a side item: on his Kendrick Lamar-led single \u201cNew Freezer,\u201d on a series of mixtapes with Migos, on label compilations. As if cognizant of this, his album, The World is Yours 2, boasts 14 features across 16 songs.\nAnd yet, somehow, Rich the Kid thinks he\u2019s a generational voice. \u201cThe album is going to be the most streamed album,\u201d he told Billboard, presumably with a straight face. \u201cI know for sure. I am the hottest artist in the fucking world.\u201d To be clear: He isn\u2019t. But he\u2019s probably right that the streaming algorithms will love him: His songs are so generic they could could auto-play after just about any popular rap song of the moment.\nHe has a ton of money and no imagination; not since Lil Boat 2 has a rapper made flexing sound so boring. \u201cThey know I got cash, I ain\u2019t gotta brag no more,\u201d he raps on \u201c4 Phones,\u201d despite the fact that he\u2019s already been bragging for nearly 30 minutes. The rare glimpse of even a half-interesting thought is usually indebted to another rapper. His pinky looks like a waterslide. His racks taller than Yao Ming. His plug\u2019s in Beijing. All ideas repurposed from artists he\u2019s worked with, most of them on this very album.\nThe best moments all come courtesy of his guests: the Jay Critch hook on \u201cLike Mike,\u201d the Gunna flow on \u201cFall Threw,\u201d the Vory song Rich basically guests on toward the end of the album (\u201cRing Ring\u201d). The clunker king Big Sean, of all people, upstages his host with the verse of the album: \u201cI go off, go in, go up, but never go back/I know we in a league of our own, bitch, I\u2019m pro-black/Just hit a lick for my grandsons and I don\u2019t have sons/But that\u2019s how far I\u2019m thinking ahead, bitch, and some,\u201d he raps on \u201cTwo Cups.\u201d There is a cleverness, a sense of identity, to his verse that the rest of the album is desperately missing.\nProduction can be the great equalizer, and The World is Yours 2 is often redeemed by its beatmakers: Frank Dukes, Wheezy Beats, T-Minus, Sevn Thomas, Nard & B, D.A. Doman, and frequent producer Lab Cook. Together, they patch the obvious cracks in his songcraft. The haunted whistling of the intro, the piercing squeal of \u201cSave That,\u201d and the booming drums of \u201cSplashin\u201d all help lacquer over the platitudinous raps. The only thing more engrossing than all this rich production is imagining, while Rich the Kid busily squanders goodwill, what a more engrossing rapper might have made of it.\n", "pptitle": ["world", "2"]}
