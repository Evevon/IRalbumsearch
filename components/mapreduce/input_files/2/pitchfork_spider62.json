Even if Young\u2019s style never approached minimalism in the classical sense, the very idea\u2014an anti-solo solo\u2014conjured a textural universe that Young has been exploring ever since, most often in live jams with Crazy Horse.\nBut it took more than two decades for Young himself to make an album of solo electric guitar music, his 1996 soundtrack to Jim Jarmusch\u2019s Dead Man. In a catalog that has ranged from the 1982 vocoder-touched Trans to the 2003 eco-rock opera Greendale, Dead Man remains the only release of its kind. A new reissue returns the spotlight to arguably the most satisfying oddity of Young\u2019s half-century career, too committed to be dismissed as a novelty.\nYoung creates a vocabulary of sound as if he\u2019d been improvising movie scores for decades\u2014a landscape of stark, expressive solo guitar to match Jarmusch\u2019s psychedelic black-and-white Western. With the tracks unnamed on their original release, the high fidelity Neil Young Archives site now titles the half-dozen instrumentals as \u201cDead Man, No. 1\u201d through \u201cDead Man, No. 6,\u201d plus \u201cOrgan Solo.\u201d They alternate with another half-dozen dialogue-based tracks, Young\u2019s guitar pushed to the background while bits of the movie come up, largely featuring Johnny Depp, who reads the poetry of William Blake. Though they provide an emotional structure for the music and are unquestionably atmospheric sound-art, they\u2019d be buzzkills even without Johnny Depp, interrupting perhaps the purest guitar playing of Young\u2019s discography. (These buzzkills, of course, can be bypassed on mediums other than vinyl.)\nYoung\u2019s closest companion to Dead Man, perhaps even a prequel of sorts, is 1991\u2019s Arc, a 35-minute extended edit of Crazy Horse\u2019s live feedback jams. While Arc might be louder, Dead Man is perhaps even further out, pushing beyond songs and rhythms and noise, and building from the new logic of the world beyond. On \u201cDead Man, No. 1,\u201d Young\u2019s guitar scratches a fluttering, almost-steady pulse while muted chords flicker, disappearing before they can resonate and reveal themselves. It ends with a 30-second melodic coda that sounds like what the narrator of Young\u2019s 1975 \u201cAlbuquerque\u201d might be hearing in their head driving through the New Mexican desert.\nEach of Dead Man\u2019s tracks offers subtly different strategies, from the dream swirl of \u201cOrgan Solo\u201d to the sustained ghost tones and scandalously indulgent two-note solo of \u201cDead Man, No. 6.\u201d The centerpiece is the 14-and-a-half minute \u201cDead Man, No. 5,\u201d filled indelibly with Young\u2019s favorite gestures as a guitarist: aching chord voicings, fuzztones, and spiky colors that open into broader fields of sound as ideas return and change shape.\nThe form of these compositions remains ambiguous, give or take moments when notes begin to connect into melodic fragments that sound viscerally like Young, accidental shards of musical personality on display. For an artist so famously committed to spontaneity and chasing idiosyncratic muses, including making films of his own, it\u2019s authentically shocking that the now 73-year-old Young has never gone further down this path. The seven fully instrumental tracks of Dead Man are Neil Young at his purest, like a rare electronic voice phenomenon recording of Young\u2019s musical spirit as it rumbles and bends and intersects with the material plane.\n", "pptitle": ["dead", "man", "origin", "soundtrack"]}
