The London singer may be one of the UK\u2019s best-selling artists of all time, with her keening pop mantras \u201cThank You\u201d and \u201cWhite Flag\u201d still reliable soundtracks in Tescos the nation over, but her even-keel approach feels removed from the volatile acrobatics and catharsis of Adele, Amy Winehouse, Ellie Goulding, and her other peers of the past two decades. Her songs still feel like the exhalation after all the action happens; in Dido songs, the tumult has been resolved by the time she records. Her breakup ballads simmer with loss and melancholy, but no regret or indecision; sweeping love anthems have no runway left for the chase, only snug contentment and bright promises to live up to another\u2019s faith. What her music lacks in heat, it makes up for in reliable serenity\u2014the sense that she\u2019s already done her emotional heavy-lifting offstage, and the song she offers is the coda, not the conduit.\nIt\u2019s extremely mature, in other words\u2014not always the sexiest bait in pop music, but a balm all its own. Dido\u2019s fifth album, Still on My Mind, guides her even more into the path of serenity and easy listening electronics, with odes to marriage and motherhood that bask in their comforts. Her most stunning asset is still her voice\u2014a glossy, palatial purr, fraying at the edges, nodding clearly to Enya and Dolores O\u2019Riordan of the Cranberries. When she sings of \u201cHurricanes,\u201d those frightening and upending sources of power, she is really asking to stand by her partner forever, so they might face them together; a delicate, late-\u201990s synth beat (from her brother and regular collaborator, Rollo Armstrong) offers up a few light gales, but nothing so forceful as the title could conjure.\nSoon after, Dido sings her harshest and most jarring lyric: \u201cI\u2019ve found a way to let you go/It\u2019s gonna rip your heart out,\u201d she offers tranquilly, with all the malice of a kitten gif, skipping up into falsetto for a dash of whimsy. (Imagine Eminem, whose sampling of her on \u201cStan\u201d made her ubiquitous, braying that same line. Marvel that they ever had a conversation, let alone shared a hit song. Let your heart swell to embrace all the gorgeous, absurd potential in this world, and then cap it with the knowledge that Dido named her son Stan.)\nElsewhere, the dance floor beckons: \u201cTake You Home\u201d rides a feathery disco pulse and an undercurrent of rakishness, below the elegant surface: \u201cI can sing you a song, take you home/But I can\u2019t seem to find my own,\u201d Dido sings, unbothered, in a neutral middle register that doesn\u2019t jump octaves or arpeggiate in any of the usual disco conventions. It\u2019s notable that in a dance track, a style that would usually suggest more momentum, Dido\u2019s singing twists in the wind; the passive house-lite backing emphasizes the lack of vocal heat. \u201cFriends,\u201d the other dance track and a confident brush-off to an ex, also simmers with a gentle, proto-\u201cTRL\u201d amiability that sounds more dated than No Angel\u2019s winsome mixes. Plenty of career pop singers have found second lives in house and EDM tracks that amped up their voices with fresh relevance, from Kelly Rowland to Lenny Kravitz and Leona Lewis; when Still on My Mind dips into the dance realm, it suggests Dido could do the same, but she\u2019d need more dynamic backing.\nOr maybe the dance tracks don\u2019t land simply because the club is not where Dido wants to be. In Still on My Mind\u2019s closing track, \u201cHave to Stay,\u201d she sounds her most enamored; nearly a capella to open, with just a puff of echo, she sings a delicate, lovely ode to her son, promising that she\u2019ll stick by his side, enduring all his young histrionics and troubles, and leave him only when he\u2019s truly ready, \u201c\u2019cause that\u2019s what love is, darling.\u201d It\u2019s the preternatural certainty Dido shows that really warms the song; on Still on My Mind, more than ever, she presents her convictions fully formed, with a confidence that can feel infectious. Of course her marriage will face storms and come out intact; of course she\u2019ll continue to shun the ghosts of her past, and guide her son towards a bright future. Here she declares it, and so shall it be.\n", "pptitle": ["mind"]}
