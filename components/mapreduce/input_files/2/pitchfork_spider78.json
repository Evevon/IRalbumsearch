An obsessive home-recording savant since his early teens, Audet (now 22) has said his goal is to record a song per day. That said, he\u2019s less a writer than a sculptor, forever picking away at the monolithic mass of musical ideas in his mind. He\u2019s as enamored with process as with results, letting us marvel at the little pieces he\u2019s chipped off along the way.\nThe Same but by Different Means is the first album Audet has released under the name Yves Jarvis, but it is by no means a debut or reset. Rather, it\u2019s the natural next step in the journey he initiated as Un Blonde. In three short years, Un Blonde gradually mutated from the clanging, cavernous post-punk of 2014\u2019s Tenet to the sublime psych-folk psalms of 2016\u2019s Good Will Come to You, with the latter record earning him a placement on Canada\u2019s Polaris Music Prize long list and, subsequently, an American deal with Anti-.\nBut rather than use that profile boost as an opportunity to streamline his sound, Audet is doubling down on his wandering DIY aesthetic. His albums have become more expansive as the tunes become much shorter, and with The Same but by Different Means, he stitches his micro-songs and abbreviated epics into a sprawling opus that\u2019s as comforting as it is uncompromising.\nAudet has said the color schemes of his album covers reflect the sound of the records, and The Same but by Different Means is Audet\u2019s interpretation of blue and all its famous connotations. But sadness isn\u2019t the feeling that overcomes you as you settle into the opening \u201cTo Say That Is Easy,\u201d a gauzy piano ballad that, just as it seems on the verge of decay, is set blissfully adrift on a soothing organ line and shuffling beat. In this case, \u201cblue\u201d assumes a more oceanic quality\u2014of flotation and immersion, of recognizing your humble standing amidst the vastness of the world.\nAudet paid his dues as a busker, and no matter what form his music has taken, he\u2019s continued to embrace simplicity and intimacy, while favoring a field-recording ambience that often sees wind sounds, chirping birds, droning insects, and passing cars serving as his de facto backing band. The aptly titled The Same but by Different Means draws from a wider instrumental palette than Audet\u2019s previous work, positioning him in the insular tradition of SMiLE-era Brian Wilson, Sly Stone circa-There\u2019s a Riot Goin\u2019 On, and early \u201870s Stevie Wonder and Todd Rundgren. But the new album retains the otherworldly aura and environmental influences of its predecessors, foregrounding the tactility of his instruments as if the sounds were being made right next to you.\nThe Same but by Different Means is surprisingly seamless for a 22-track record. Like a Ouija board session, each track here feels part of a collective effort to access a realm outside our own. Sometimes, it leads to sustained moments of connection, like the radiant tropicalia sunshower of \u201cCurtain of Rain.\u201d At others, it yields sudden, surprising moments of rapture, like the beautiful melancholic chorus of \u201cHard to Say Bye.\u201d Even the briefest snippets can feel like statements: \u201cConstant Change\u201d is a 30-second a capella hymn whose only decipherable lyric is its repeated title.  However, as Audet manipulates the tape to sound like a scratching record, it\u2019s transformed into a meta-commentary on the chaos of modern life and the desire to slow down and stop the world from spinning off its axis.\nTellingly, the phrase \u201cconstant change\u201d keeps popping up, and The Same but by Different Means can be seen as Audet\u2019s attempt to come to terms with it. The album charts his quest for inner peace in real time, whether Audet is confessing to his own creative stagnation amid the slow-motion psych soul of \u201cNothing New\u201d or pondering his place in the world on the church-organ confessional \u201cTalking or Listening?\u201d But with the closer, \u201cThe Truth,\u201d he finds sanctuary. Stretching out its acoustic idyll for eight enchanting minutes, the song buries Audet\u2019s muttered spoken-word vocals just below the surface, as an encroaching symphony of sampled TV sounds threatens to drown him out. It\u2019s like a dream where you can\u2019t quite make out the details, but it is peaceful, not unnerving. Perhaps finding serenity means surrendering your will to understand the world around you. For Audet, and maybe for us, it\u2019s enough to calmly coexist within it.\n", "pptitle": ["differ", "mean"]}
