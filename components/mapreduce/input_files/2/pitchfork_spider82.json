There is no collectively imprinted youth to risk failing to recapture. By 1984\u2019s immortal Meat Puppets II, they were already perfectly weathered and weird and an anathema to punk orthodoxy, finding the bridge between the Dead and the Dead Kennedys long before it was fashionable. The band was easy enough to classify as psychedelic\u2014not in an indulgent or Day-Glo way, but in a way that suggested guzzling buckets of homemade drugs and happening upon musical instruments which they then played at whatever speed and volume felt sustainable in the moment. Their zeitgeist moment as guests of honor on 1994\u2019s Nirvana\u2019s MTV Unplugged in New York delivered Curt and Cris Kirkwood to the masses as old souls whose songs had earned pride of place alongside Bowie and Leadbelly.\nThe Meat Puppets\u2019 15th album in 37 years\u2014their first with original drummer Derrick Bostrum since 1995, fifth since bassist Cris rejoined following fraught years of addiction and legal troubles, and third with Curt\u2019s son Elmo playing guitar\u2014serves as a defense of that thesis. Twenty-five long years later, the Kirkwood brothers have grown into their grizzledness. They now look like the sun-stroked prospectors they have always channeled, and Dusty Notes does what it says on the tin: It\u2019s earthy and out of time, casual and familiar, and wholly at ease with itself. They aren\u2019t trying to make an argument that punk and country can coexist or share DNA or an outlaw spirit; they aren\u2019t trying to argue about anything much at all.\nThe loud rawk guitars that were still dominant as of their previous album, 2013\u2019s Rat Farm, are largely confined to the background here. Of the 10 tracks, only one, the prog-metal mini-opus \u201cVampyr\u2019s Winged Fantasy,\u201d even attempts to broach raucousness or racket. The other nine, including a spirited cover of Don Gibson\u2019s \u201cSea of Heartbreak\u201d (perhaps best known via Johnny Cash\u2019s 1996 American-recorded version and come to think of it, it\u2019s kind of wild that Rick Rubin never fed Cash \u201cLake of Fire\u201d to try out during any of those sessions, that would have been perfect, but anyway), rest comfortably on the reserved, honky-tonk side of the spectrum, some distance from their youthful shredding and shrieking or their Too High To Die-era 120 minutes of fame.\nOpening track \u201cWarranty\u201d positively bounces thanks to its octave-jumping bassline, while banjo and mariachi horns anchor \u201cNine Pins\u201d and the title track, respectively; \u201cOn\u201d and \u201cThe Great Awakening\u201d are mid-tempo piano-based ballads. In aggregate, none of this feels like a departure\u2014it\u2019s somehow a step backward and forward at the same time, mining roots as a way to age gracefully.\n", "pptitle": ["dusti", "note"]}
