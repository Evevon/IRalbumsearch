Back in 2014, clips of the multi-platinum, Grammy-winning artist singing without the aid of Auto-Tune for NPR\u2019s \u201dTiny Desk\u201d series quickly went viral for their deft display of vocal control, proving that the man who soundtracked our high school proms and parties with pitch-corrected pop anthems could command a room with his God-given croon. Now, five years later, he\u2019s shocking us once again, this time by winning a reality singing competition that required him to shroud his identity in a furry cyclops costume and belt Sam Smith ballads. The show\u2019s judges guessed the identity of \u201cThe Monster\u201d was a former R&B star, like Jamie Foxx or Tyrese Gibson, or even Darius Rucker. No one considered the Rappa Ternt Sanga, who, upon shedding his mask and on the verge of tears, explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to enter the game with my natural voice...this helped get my voice out there.\u201d It only took a few performances dressed like a nightmarish Monsters, Inc. character to do so.\nThis isn\u2019t really T-Pain\u2019s fault. With the massive success of his early singles like \u201cI\u2019m Sprung,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m N Luv (Wit a Stripper)\u201d and \u201cBuy U a Drank,\u201d he ushered in a new landscape for pop music that\u2019s still going strong today, influencing everyone from Paul McCartney to A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie to harmonize through an audio processor. Thus it\u2019s hard to separate T-Pain from the technology that he reintroduced to the world (it first infiltrated pop nearly a decade earlier on Cher\u2019s 1998 smash \u201cBelieve\u201d) and continues to lean on heavily. By the same token, his refusal to try anything new on his recent albums has stifled his ability to capitalize on the goodwill he\u2019s garnered. His newest project, 1UP, is no different, with many of its 12 tracks sounding like they could have come from his 2005 debut. As a result, what starts as a fun ride down memory lane quickly turns into a grating slog by a trendsetter who frustratingly still hasn\u2019t gotten his due.\nThings start out relatively strong with the opening title track, which sees T-Pain strike a more serious tone than usual. Over filtered synth plucks and stuttering snare claps, he harmonizes from the other side of the phone to a friend in jail, wondering what placed them on opposite ends of freedom. \u201cPhone smell like tears, how my dawg get up in there,\u201d he sighs. Its barreling energy and introspectiveness recall the work of fellow crooner Future, who took T-Pain\u2019s digitized sound and made it darker and harder-hitting to critical and commercial success. The profundity pretty much ends there, though. A few songs later and we\u2019re at \u201cU Up,\u201d a prototypical T-Pain love lullaby that captures the feeling of running across a picture of an ex on social media and wanting to text them after one too many whiskey sours.\n\u201cU Up,\u201d although nostalgic, is representative of the predictability of 1UP, which by and large incorporates the same snap sounds used on past hits like \u201cBuy U a Drank.\u201d The album is filled with rehashes of old material, whether it\u2019s the chest-bumping camaraderie of 2010\u2019s star-studded DJ Khaled collab \u201cAll I Do Is Win\u201d on the party anthem \u201cIt\u2019s My Dog\u2019s Birthday\u201d or the gentle keys of 2008\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Believe It\u201d on the ballad \u201cBe Your X.\u201d Many of his bad habits as a lyricist still linger, too, as he often crosses the line between being playful and juvenile, like on \u201cHere It Comes,\u201d which opens with the painfully clumsy line, \u201cI put the hurt on the derriere,\u201d or \u201cKeep This From Me,\u201d where he devotes the chorus to brazenly cussing out a partner\u2019s parents. Features by Canadian singer Tory Lanez and rapper Russ, known for their simplistic and sometimes crass approach to heavy subject matter, don\u2018t help.\nAnd then there\u2019s the Auto-Tune, which, by the end of the album, is suffocating in its repetitiveness; not even a lighter-flicking Lil Wayne, Pain\u2019s longest-running collaborator, can help breathe life into the project on its final track. Rather than giving his vocals a go minus filters or switching the production to lean into the acoustic nature of his viral performances, T-Pain instead relies on a tired formula.\nThe one saving grace of 1UP is that he still knows how to craft earworms, most clearly encapsulated by the song \u201cWe All We Got.\u201d Its impish melody and sing-along hook draw my mind to another artist heavily influenced by Pain, Tierra Whack, whose most-recent project Whack World acts as a more decadent and straightforward version of his songwriting, with its warbled choruses and short runtimes. \u201cWe Got\u201d follows a similar path, essentially functioning as one big chorus and thus making it a breeze compared to other tracks on 1UP, many of which stretch over four minutes long. Maybe this is the groundwork for Pain\u2019s next project; if he can\u2019t take cues from himself, he can from others like Whack.\n", "pptitle": ["1up"]}
