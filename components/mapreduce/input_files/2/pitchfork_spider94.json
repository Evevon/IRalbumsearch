In 2015, the Philadelphia band released one of the most disgusting death metal albums in recent history, Suicide Euphoria. A more frenzied version of Revenge\u2019s blasting war metal, the album led with cover art where bones floated in what\u2019s most politely called brown death goop. Posthumous Humiliation makes the gore even more clear, sporting a ripped-open face with its jaw prominently split in two. If you\u2019re familiar with goregrind\u2019s frequently exploitative, voyeuristic tradition, it\u2019s nothing new, though most goregrind bands wouldn\u2019t pass the muster of a tastemaking, subgenre-agnostic label like Profound Lore. As such, some potential Pissgrave fans may actually be turned off by such a blatantly malevolent image. But the music matches it: Posthumous Humiliation is gratuitously violent, getting off on its own vulgarity. It is not the first great death metal album of 2019 in spite of being reprehensible but because of it.\nPissgrave are again chiefly driven by war metal\u2019s savagery-above-all approach, but the crucial difference comes this time with intensity. Despite its fury, war metal\u2014black metal concentrated on speed and near-endless blasting, nothing else\u2014is tight and controlled. Pissgrave are not sloppy, but they understand that carnage is messy, and their music should reflect that reality. Humiliation is louder and noisier than Euphoria, as Demian Fenton and Tim Mellon render endless sheets of mangled guitar noise, screamingly incoherent but cohesive. Blown-out riffs, torrential blastbeats, and vocals so low they seem subterranean crowd the same space, inseparable in their pain. \u201cEmaciated\u201d has what you could loosely call guitar solos, so damaged they make Kerry King\u2019s Reign in Blood squabbles sound like the disciplined work of some YouTube shredder. Even when these leads suggest something familiar, like the swells and carnivorous bird pecks of \u201cInto the Deceased,\u201d they feel wonderfully senseless.\nAs with the cover, those guitar sounds may suggest that Pissgrave only provide denim-and-leather\u2019s version of shock and awe. But there\u2019s more here. Where their chaos ultimately leads is not as important as its blistering, tumultuous course, akin to Cecil Taylor\u2019s percussive, jarring piano flights or Australian extremists Impetuous Ritual\u2019s howling towers of noise. They seem free and unplanned, not deliberate. Each track is a new trial, a chance to live again through a cycle of misery and pain. Are the opening blasts in \u201cCanticle of Ripping Flesh\u201d and \u201cCelebratory Defilement\u201d the same as opener \u201cEuthanasia?\u201d Not quite\u2014it just feels that cyclical, the ultimate source of Pissgrave\u2019s bloodlust. \u201cCatacombs of Putrid Chambers\u201d seems like it offers a different path through Incantation-like dirges, yet it\u2019s ultimately the same torture.\nDespite how frenzied, blurred, and gory Pissgrave can become, they sometimes charge toward a horizon of approachability. For Euphoria, it was the thrashy, Power Trip-via-Absu tune, \u201cThe Second Sorrowful Mystery.\u201d Here, the closing moments of \u201cRusted Wind\u201d draw upon Dissection\u2019s melodic mournful passages. Melodic? Yes, this record really is that fucked up. \u201cWind\u201d is the funeral procession that follows Humiliation\u2019s wave of violence. It\u2019s as though they\u2019re grieving, if not exactly remorseful.\nIt\u2019s tempting to dismiss Humiliation as a mere edgelord monument, propaganda with no core. But you\u2019re missing the point: Even if you\u2019re incapable or uninterested in hurting anything, your internal life can feel ravaged and violent and chaotic. Pissgrave\u2019s utter depravity proudly maps those feelings on Posthumous Humiliation; some days, this mess may be the only thing that makes sense.\n", "pptitle": ["posthum", "humili"]}
