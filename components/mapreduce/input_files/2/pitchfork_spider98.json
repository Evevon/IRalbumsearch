That might seem better suited to a utility company\u2014until you hear the music coming out of it. Over a wide-ranging catalog of sputtering electronics, noise, and on-the-fritz club music, L.I.E.S. brings to mind Throbbing Gristle\u2019s \u201cindustrial music for industrial people\u201d slogan, right down to its well-oiled release schedule. A notable early showcase was the 2013 compilation Music for Shut-Ins\u2014a fitting title for its dark, murky, hermetic take on electronic music. With the new Eminent Domain, a self-described collection of \u201csubterranean American electronics,\u201d L.I.E.S. drags some of the underground\u2019s finest basement dwellers into the sunlight, and it\u2019s one of the label\u2019s best compilations yet.\nSpread over three LPs and a bonus 7\u201d, the sprawling Eminent Domain works well anywhere you might dive in, but label head Ron Morelli seems to take extra care in sequencing its 22 tracks. There\u2019s a crazed logic in the way their prickly edges connect and clash. The compilation takes its time to open up with atmospheric early tracks like of Prisons\u2019 \u201cTell Lie Visions,\u201d a scene of choked keyboard torture, before JT Whitfield\u2019s saw-blade synth jam \u201cBleak Speak\u201d fully straps you in for the funhouse horrors to follow. With few recognizable names, you never quite know what surprises will pop out.\nMinneapolis\u2019 noise artist CBN is a great example. With only a few extremely limited-run cassettes, it\u2019s hard to even obtain his work, but the stunning EBM workout \u201cWho Has Time for Tears\u201d may send you in search of more. The track\u2019s propulsive drum machine and ghostly moans build over six relentless minutes before turning to bloody screams and noise that nearly sparkles in its harshness. For many, it will be a memorable introduction, but for Eminent Domain, it acts as another crucial cog, kicking off a seamless B-side as it gives way to FILTH\u2019s prickly, agitated \u201cCrucial Point\u201d before Daniel Holt\u2019s \u201cNear the Window\u201d provides a comedown of doom-laced synths. The three tracks work together to carve their side of the LP into its own unique corner; it\u2019s not the only place on the compilation that this happens.\nLos Angeles noise veteran Suzy Poling, aka Pod Blotz, offers another of Eminent Domain\u2019s highlights with \u201cBeyond the Body,\u201d transforming her voice into a wounded electrical signal and threading it through blunt drumbeats and ethereal synths. It\u2019s balanced by L.I.E.S. alum 51717\u2019s \u201c\u05d0\u05d3\u05d2\u05de\u05d4\u201d, which approaches ambient music and provides a midway breather, but also cleverly sets the listener up for fake-outs like Skander\u2019s \u201cRunning Into Danger,\u201d a blissful soundscape interrupted midway through by hellish percussion. The only genuine moment of peace is saved until the very last track: \u201cThe Swan King,\u201d from Hospital Productions regular Lussuria. It all gives Eminent Domain a full-circle finish, making it both a brilliant collection of clashing parts and an organic whole all at once.\n", "pptitle": ["emin", "domain"]}
