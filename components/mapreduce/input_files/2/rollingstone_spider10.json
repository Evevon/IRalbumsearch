This set finally bundles the evidence: 34 tracks, including some of the avant-pop auteur\u2019s most gorgeous, extravagant, intimate, and bonkers material \u2014 b-sides, remixes, and an album\u2019s-worth of stray, often strange covers.\r\n\r\nTake the reading of \u201cRocket Man,\u201d written by another soulmate, Elton John, arranged with fiddle and uilleann pipes into loping Celtic reggae (something to do, perhaps, with the \u201chigh as a kite\u201d line?) His Marilyn Monroe tribute \u201cCandle In The Wind,\u201d meanwhile, gets swirled into ambient synth-pop, Bush veering midsong, it seems, from fangirl into Monroe herself, as she chirps the word \u201csuperstar\u201d \u2014 a state Bush knew plenty about herself when she tracked this in \u201991, years before the song was reimagined as a tribute to another British icon. Uilleann pipes also color an oddly perky, pitched-up cover of Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cSexual Healing,\u201d alternately sung and whispered, with dubby synths billowing in the background and a choir of backing vocals. The Billie Holiday vehicle \u201cThe Man I Love\u201d gets a less-radical transformation, with production/arrangement by George Martin in the style of Lady Day\u2019s 1939 Vocalion recording, complete with muted trumpet. As with most of her covers of classics, Bush charts a course between respecting the original and being Kate Bush, a fascinating dance that can feel restrained by politesse.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s never an issue with the originals. The crown jewel here might be \u201cUnder The Ivy,\u201d which Cloud Atlas author David Mitchell calls her \u201cmeta-song\u201d in his introduction to her 2018 lyric compendium How To Be Invisible. \u201cUnder The Ivy\u201d is just a handful of piano chords and Bush\u2019s raw voice, with a touch of electronic processing, the singer first beckoning, then imploring a listener to burrow into a secret place, conjuring intimacy, invention, self-discovery and sex with a slightly frightening intensity. It\u2019s so singular and self-contained in its two minutes and 10 seconds, it\u2019s no wonder she released it as a b-side, as it might throw most any album off-course.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s plenty more to (re-) discover. The French version of\u00a0Never For Ever's \u201cThe Infant Kiss\u201d (\u201cUn Baiser D'Enfant\u201d), based on the 1961 film The Innocents, and the French original \u201cNe T'Enfuis Pas,\u201d make a diptych suggesting Bush might\u2019ve had a nifty collaboration with Serge Gainsbourg. With its hollered declaration \u201cit\u2019s you and me babe, against the world!,\u201d \u201cBurning Bridge\u201d is one of her most dizzying vocals; at point she sounds like she\u2019s making herself seasick. \u201cYou Want Alchemy\u201d is a fairly jaw-dropping Prince channeling with strings, r&b brass, feral orgasmic squealing and gospel-infused backing vocals. The 12\u201d versions, more extensions than reinventions, include the unhinged \u201cmeterological mix\u201d of the Hounds Of Love single \u201cBig Sky,\u201d pumped up with machine-gun handclaps and didgeridoo drones. Completists will notice some omissions, like the 1979 live EP On Stage, which documents the only tour of her career, and her sole live shows before the Hammersmith Apollo residency 35 years later (check the glam-tastically proggy, partly shrieked 6-minute version of \u201cJames & The Cold Gun\u201d).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the motherlode is here. Bush\u2019s oeuvre is singular, and has stood alone for decades. But lately its brilliance feels especially prescient, reflected variously in the sound and approach of (among others) Robyn, Florence Welch, and Annie St. Vincent Clark, whose confession of tipsy karaoke-ing \u201cWuthering Heights\u201d is one of the highlights of that delicious 2014 Bush documentary. So the timing of this deep-cuts set couldn\u2019t be better. Most of the tracks feel as contemporary as they ever did; maybe more so.", "pptitle": ["review", "motherlod", "kate", "bush", "rariti", "issu", "side", "roll", "stone"]}
