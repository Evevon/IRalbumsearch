With \u201cLucid Dreams,\u201d Juice WRLD more or less grafted Dashboard\u2019s emotional blueprint onto clacking percussion and booming 808s. Whereas \u201cInsecurities\u201d is an intimate coffeehouse joint meant to be received by an audience of dozens, \u201cLucid Dreams\u201d is a song that wants the entire universe to hear it. For Juice WRLD, love is like Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot, an epic, swirling tempest too powerful for our frail human hearts to comprehend or bear.\r\n\r\n\u201cLucid Dreams\u201d reached #2 on the Hot 100 last June and turned Juice WRLD into the poster child for emo rap practically overnight. Since October, he has released a joint mixtape with Future, celebrated his 20th birthday, and embarked on a European tour with Nicki Minaj. The early Lil Uzi Vert and Post Malone comparisons he garnered have proven prescient; Juice is now nearly as popular as both of them. On his new album Death Race for Love, his chronic depression, drug abuse and lovesickness collide with his sudden wealth, fame and status.\r\n\r\nDeath Race builds on Juice\u2019s instinct to distill emotion rather than tell a story. On the opening track \u201cEmpty,\u201d he gestures towards the affected nihilism of his 2018 debut album Goodbye and Good Riddance and uncorks the incredible eye-roller, \u201cMy world revolves around a black hole / the same black hole that\u2019s in place of my soul.\u201d Death Race is rife with clunkers like these but its 22 tracks also constitute an unmistakable step forward for Juice WRLD\u2019s sadboy aesthetic, which has now become broader and more richly textured. The album\u2019s most compelling moments are Juice\u2019s realizations that his money won\u2019t solve his problems: \u201cIt's been months since I felt at home / But it's okay 'cause I'm rich / Sike, I'm still sad as a bitch,\u201d he sings matter-of-factly on \u201cFast.\u201d On \u201cRobbery,\u201d he offers the reverse humblebrag, \u201cOne thing my dad told me was, \u2018Never let your woman know when you're insecure\u2019 / So I put Gucci on the fur / And I put my wrist on iceberg.\u201d These admissions provide a grounding context for his emotional distress that his previous work has generally lacked; here, he appears less of an avatar of suffering and more like a human.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have songs for the trap house, songs for the sock hop, songs for the Caribbeans, songs for raves, songs for slow dancing,\u201d Juice said in a recent interview with Rolling Stone. This turns out to be true on Death Race, where he\u2019s expanded his sound with help from veteran producers like Hit-Boy, Boi-1da, Cardo. No I.D., and Jahaan Sweet. The album\u2019s samples of \u201cSicko Mode\u201d organ (\u201cOut My Way\u201d), Daniel Caesar\u2019s \u201cWho Hurt You\u201d (\u201c10 Feet\u201d), and Pharcyde\u2019s \u201cRunnin\u2019\u201d (\u201cMake Believe\u201d)\u201d are representative of the way it alternately leans into various mainstream trends and floats unforeseen experiments. Similarly, Juice frequently digresses from his rap game Mark Hoppus routine to rap more, and also to try out Offset\u2019s barking ad-libs (\u201cBig\u201d), Ski Mask\u2019s chuckles, XXXTentacion\u2019s screams (\u201cSyphillis\u201d) and Travis Scott\u2019s drugged-out croon (\u201cThe Bees Knees\u201d). He\u2019s still searching for the ideal balance of preening and wallowing, but he\u2019s getting closer.\r\n\r\nJuice takes a few gambles on Death Race, and they all pay off. He yields an entire song to the ruminative Baltimore R&B singer Brent Faiyaz, and he allots one of the album\u2019s three guest verses to Clever, a 34-year-old journeyman rapper from Alabama, who yearns for Postmates more passionately on wax than anyone ever before. These unexpected moments spark joy in Juice WRLD\u2019s often joyless world in a way that too many moments\u2014like when he uses some variation of the phrase \u201cnumb my feels\u201d for the umpteenth time, or spells out \u201cwinning\u201d like he\u2019s in the Scripps National Spelling Bee\u2014do not.\r\n\r\nStill, Death Race succeeded in its most fundamental mission, which was to prove that \u201cLucid Dreams\u201d was not a fluke. Songs like \u201cFast,\u201d \u201cRing, \u201cHear Me Calling\u201d strike a dynamic balance of raw charisma and profound anxiety, and, this summer, at least one of them will likely make a run on the charts and solidify Juice WRLD\u2019s status as a genuine pop dynamo. While his melodrama tends to grow old over the course of a 22-track, 72-minute album, it is captivating in small doses.", "pptitle": ["review", "juic", "wrld", "evolv", "sadboy", "aesthet", "death", "race", "love", "roll", "stone"]}
