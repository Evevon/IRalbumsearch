Over the past decade, the singer-songwriter-multi-instrumentalist has made his mark as the mastermind auteur behind the blissed out jams and shaggy rock mythmaking of Strand of Oaks. \u201cI was lonely,\u201d he sang on the cautious nostalgia trip of his 2014 breakthrough \u201cGoshen 97,\u201d \u201cbut I was having fun!\u201d\r\n\r\nFive years later, Showalter spends the majority of his new album meditating on what to do when that fun grows stale and creating your own rock and roll legend starts feeling tired. Eraserland, his latest LP, puts forth a rather convincing argument that turning 36 years old as a guitar player is, in fact, a high-stakes spiritual crisis: \u201cI\u2019ll be that bartender with boring stories,\u201d he sings longingly on \u201cKeys,\u201d one of the album\u2019s several middle-aged \u201cmove to LA\u201d fantasies, \u201cI gotta get my shit together before I\u2019m 40.\u201d\r\n\r\nRecording with members of My Morning Jacket, Showalter sounds re-energized on this dynamic collection of spaced out power pop and dreamy psych-rock that owes a bit to fellow Philadelphians War on Drugs. The record\u2019s ten songs trace the songwriter\u2019s sober reflections and search for tranquility amidst glam-Bowie guitar freakouts (\u201cHyperspace Blues\u201d), transcendent Crazy Horse jams (\u201cForever Chords\u201d), and oddball tributes to Malcolm Young (\u201cMoon Landing\u201d). \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a fresh clarity to Showalter\u2019s latest that feels far removed from the anxious, claustrophobic reverb-rock of 2017\u2019s Hard Love and 2014\u2019s Heal. If Showalter has become newly focused on carving out new spaces for self-betterment in his songwriting, so too do the recordings themselves, produced by Kevin Ratterman; they have more room to breath, and less need to clutter Showalter\u2019s musings with layers of guitars. The result is Strand of Oaks\u2019 most lasting, accessible album yet, one that\u2019s not as concerned with its own internal drama and more interested in communicating the power in dreaming up a better life. \u201cI am the eraserland,\u201d as Showalter puts it, \u201cI can start again.\u201d", "pptitle": ["review", "strand", "oak", "come", "middl", "age", "reflect", "eraserland", "roll", "stone"]}
