At his best, his narrative skills tilt towards the idiosyncratic and specific \u2014 see the title track of his 2014 LP KMAG YOYO, a first-person military narrative about an acid-droppin\u2019, heroin-hustlin\u2019 recruit in Afganistan. On Lovers and Leavers, Carll made a fairly straightforward, universal LP about the joys, heartbreaks and pratfalls of relationships. It was potent, but the worldly barstool wiseass was missed.\r\n\r\nFor What It Is, the Texas songsmith marshals all his storyteller modes. And maybe to tap into the aforementioned world of stories, he\u2019s brought in other writing voices, more than usual. Foremost is singer-songwriter Allison Moorer, his fianc\u00e9e, who co-produced What It Is and co-wrote half its 12 songs. Unsurprisingly for two lovebird divorcees (Moorer was previously married to Steve Earle), plenty of the songs look take a clear-eyed look at relationships. They include \u201cNone\u2019ya\u201d \u2014 as in \u201cnone\u2019ya business\u201d \u2014 involving a sniping couple clearly in love, and clearly unafraid to call each other out on their mishegas. \u201cThings You Don\u2019t Wanna Know,\u201d a slow-churning southern soul gem complete with bluesy horns, does a similar thing in the voice of a guy struggling with bad habits, and holding secrets that might be best left that way. \u201cNobody wants to hear the truth/ They only wanna see a show,\u201d he sings, in a line reflecting both the song narrative and our current political circus.\r\n\r\nIn moments like these, the showman and the soul man in Carll come together in new harmony. On \u201cTimes Like These,\u201d a rowdy country-rocker about the travails of a working man, the singer takes his emotional temperature and perhaps the planet\u2019s too: \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to tell if this is heaven or hell and I can never measure by degrees/But it\u2019s sure getting warm around here in times like these.\u201d Polemics are mostly sly, and better for it. \u201cWild Pointy Finger\u201d is a judge-not exercise with witty turns (\u201cI\u2019ve got ten digits like most other people/I can build the church but I can\u2019t hold the steeple.\u201d) Even better is \u201cFragile Men,\u201d a co-write with Lauren Pritchard (aka Lolo) that seems to target Confederate-flag-clutching racists, gynophobes, and other supposed-good-ol\u2019-days fetishists with surgical sarcasm: \u201cThe whole world is exploding/And I know it feels so strange/\u2028It must make you so damn angry/They're expecting you to change,\u201d croons Carll, a one-man Greek chorus, echoed by hilariously weeping pedal steel and lush strings.\r\n\r\nThen there\u2019s \u201cJesus and Elvis,\u201d a quintessential Carll character study after John Prine, co-written with Moorer and the great Matraca Berg. It\u2019s a song so undeniable in its craft that Kenny Chesney cut it back in 2016; Carll dials back the delivery a bit here, which only improves it. Like the work of another artist who recently envisioned a velvet Elvis, it\u2019s songwriting that doesn\u2019t pander to mainstream country, alt-country, so-called Americana, indie-folk, or what-have you. It just tells its story, indelibly.", "pptitle": ["review", "hay", "carll", "wiseass", "lovestruck", "new", "album", "roll", "stone"]}
