Even the poets laureate of beach bonfires and keg stands have moved on: In 2016, Florida Georgia Line\u2019s Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley reinvented themselves with the pseudo-Christian pop ballad \u201cH.O.L.Y.,\u201d which they followed in 2018 with their anodyne Bebe Rexha collaboration, \u201cMeant to Be.\u201d\r\n\r\nEnter Can\u2019t Say I Ain\u2019t Country, Florida Georgia Line\u2019s jumbled claim for the genre\u2019s ever-changing center. One of the album\u2019s central reference points is the latest LP from ex-labelmate Taylor Swift: This is something like their own Reputation, a defensive, winking response from the act that\u2019s come to serve as shorthand for everything wrong with modern country. It\u2019s full of attempts to shore up their credibility, along with jabs at detractors (see the title track and the Nineties-rap-referencing skits).\r\n\r\nAt 19 tracks, FGL\u2019s fourth album often feels more like a streaming-era hip-hop blockbuster than a traditional Nashville LP. This is playlist country, with a cross-section of sounds \u2014 R&B slow jams, thumping country rockers, folky Edward Sharpe knockoffs \u2014 that\u2019s wide enough to appeal to any subset of the group\u2019s pop fan base.\r\n\r\nThe most memorable parts of Can\u2019t Say I Ain\u2019t Country are in the lyrics, which outline FGL\u2019s modern South in potent detail: the dead-end jobs, the orange peels rotting on barroom floors, the man washing down a gas station biscuit with Mountain Dew, the couple saying grace in a Mexican restaurant.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, Hubbard and Kelley work too hard to chase country\u2019s recent trends. \u201cWomen,\u201d featuring Jason DeRulo, is a halfhearted try at the grown-man female-appreciation anthems that are all over country airwaves; \u201cPeople Are Different\u201d is a boilerplate take on the Trump-era pleas for compassion that Kenny Chesney, Carrie Underwood and Luke Bryan all released in 2018.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe used to live on Instagram,\u201d Hubbard sings, \u201cworried about who-all gives a damn.\u201d But when FGL stop partying and put down their phones, they sound more worried than ever. The result is an uneven record that leaves country\u2019s most irreverent hitmakers sounding needlessly cautious.", "pptitle": ["album", "review", "florida", "georgia", "line", "say", "aint", "countri", "roll", "stone"]}
