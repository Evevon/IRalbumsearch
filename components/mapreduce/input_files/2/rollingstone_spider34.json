It\u2019s tremendously beautiful music, and profoundly sad, but also full of hope, because sad beauty can do that.\r\nThe group revolves around Zach Condon, whose voice is winsomely handsome: There are traces of Morrissey in his phrasing and parts of his lower register, Rufus Wainwright in his upper range, though his delivery's more low-key than either. And he\u2019s always had a thing for brass band music: Balkan, Mexican, Italian. It\u2019s not such an odd combination. Jostling, mournful Balkan-tinged brass was enshrined as indie-rock gesture back in the late Nineties via Neutral Milk Hotel (whose Jeremy Barnes later played with\u00a0Beirut). Condon's built an entire world with globetrotting horn charts at or near the heart, and\u00a0Gallipoli\u00a0revisits it with some of his most emotive songwriting and singing.\r\nThe overture of the title track is hallucinatory, conjuring sad Salvation Army bands playing for coins, or war-torn Eastern European village halls, with clattering percussion mapping archaic jigs, Moog and Farfisa touches for 20th-century color. \u201cWe tell tales to be known/or to be spared from sorrow,\u201d Condon croons, perhaps conscious of the impossibility of either, yet throwing himself into the attempt anyway.\r\nCurrently based in the indie-rock outpost of Berlin (Bob Mould is another resident expat), the LP was recorded partly there, partly in the Apulia region of Southern Italy, and partly in Condon's old stomping ground of New York. Perhaps unsurprisingly,\u00a0Gallipoli\u00a0is about dislocation. \u201cVarieties of Exile\u201d seems to include acute existentialism in its list, whereas the dreamy instrumental \u201cCorfu,\u201d named for the Greek island, vaguely echoes Kool and the Gang\u2019s \u201cSummer Madness.\u201d\u00a0 That segues into \u201cLandslide,\u201d not a Fleetwood Mac cover but a lament involving a natural disaster \u201cback home\u201d \u2014 a metaphor, perhaps? \u2014 with more Moog, here recalling the \u201870s work of Brian Eno, who has also made memorable music in Berlin (see David Bowie\u2019s\u00a0Low\u00a0and\u00a0Heroes). \u201cFamily Curse\u201d echoes '70s Eno as well, specifically the chintzy syndrums on \u201cSombre Reptiles,\u201d then blossoms into an ecstasy of minimalist horn patterns.\r\nIn a lovely closing cascade of allusions, \u201cWe Never Lived Here\u201d also suggests classic minimalism, Richard Landry\u2019s horn work on Philip Glass\u2019s\u00a0Einstein On The Beach\u00a0in particular. \u201cWe Never Lived Here\u201d is a song how someone can feel centered even in a place where they have no history, but for the one they\u2019re creating right now, minute by minute, like every immigrant with determination and a vision.", "pptitle": ["review", "beirut", "return", "haunt", "gallipoli", "roll", "stone"]}
