So it\u2019s welcome and fitting to hear new music from ex-frontman Bob Mould during America\u2019s current cultural crisis. What may surprise some, though, is how violently happy Mould can sound on Sunshine Rock. \u201cLook above you, I will love you/In the sunshine\u201d he hollers on the title track, savoring the feel of \u201ca cool breeze blowing through my beard\u201d with a tambourine shimmy, \u201cbop-bop-ba-dop\u201d backing vocals, and the Prague TV Orchestra sawing merrily away. Things sound even brighter on \u201cSunny Love Song,\u201d Mould snarling, \u201cMy troubles, they have ended/ My sorrows ended too/\u2028I should write a sunny love song every day/ I will shine so bright on you so true.\u201d And \u201cCamp Sunshine,\u201d a gently strummed ballad about the escapist joys of making music, glows like an indie-rock Moonrise Kingdom.\r\n\r\nBut no worries, dark-siders \u2014 there are shit-tons of worries here. Sunshine Rock is more about fighting for love and happiness than realizing it in any stable way. \u201cEvery day I ask myself/How and when does sadness end? /Many ways to hurt myself/ Lost again,\u201d Mould sings on \u201cLost Faith,\u201d a song that see-saws between bottoming out and yanking oneself up from the abyss. It\u2019s a resonant tension mirrored across the entire album. \u201cSin King\u201d suggests a failed love affair, but also a metaphor of an American who feels his country has broken faith (Mould has recently been living in Berlin). \u201cThe Final Years\u201d is a mid-tempo meditation on how to spend your golden years. Any contemplation of mortality here stands to reason: Mould\u2019s friend and H\u00fcsker D\u00fc bandmate Grant Hart died in 2017 in the wake of their curating the Savage Young D\u00fc compilation, a massive anthology of the group\u2019s earliest recordings, most nearing 40 years old.\r\n\r\nThose experiences might explain Sunshine Rock\u2019s intensity, though Mould isn\u2019t known for chill-out music, fondness for German techno notwithstanding. Among the album's most ferocious songs is \u201cThirty Dozen Roses,\u201d a hairshirt thrasher about being a \u201clousy prick\u201d which steamrolls over questionable puns with a H\u00fcsker-ish hardcore attack. The most delightful might be \u201cSend Me A Postcard,\u201d the album\u2019s sole cover, a remake of the 1968 single by the Shocking Blue, a Jefferson Airplane-ish garage-psych gem that finds Mould raging \u201cHow can I make you understand? I wanna be your woman!\u201d It\u2019s totally awesome, tortured and joyous in perfect balance, and it does what Mould\u2019s music has always done, even at its bleakest \u2014 exorcising demons through rock noise. \u201cBaby, we all lose faith in troubled times,\u201d he sings at one point on Sunshine Rock. Then he shakes it off, and keeps moving.", "pptitle": ["bob", "mould", "channel", "hsker", "d", "savag", "upbeat", "sunshin", "rock", "roll", "stone"]}
