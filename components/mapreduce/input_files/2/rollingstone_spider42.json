His major-label debut, The Bigger Artist, reached Number Four on the Billboard 200 in 2017, out-selling long-established national stars like Miley Cyrus. It's easy to see why: A Boogie is winningly open, even when expressing scorn or torment or shame. \"Tryna keep it cool like the time I was in the studio with Future and his goons,\" he raps touchingly on the new track \"4 Min Convo (Favorite Song).\" \"Sittin' next to my favorite rapper, actin' scared to say it to him.\"\r\nAnd A Boogie's sing-song style \u2014 \"Melody nigga, she need me,\" he boasts on \"Beasty\"\u2014 ensures that his tracks feel incongruously bright despite all the scorched-earth seduction. As he puts it on \"Odee,\" \"It's a hip-hop song, but I'm R&B-ing;\" Hoodie SZN is packed full of references to Michael Jackson.\r\nThis album is fashionably long, but A Boogie's childlike bitterness stays cutting throughout. \"Blame my ex, that bitch, she did me dirty/ Had me fall in love and then she curved me,\" he raps cruelly on \"Swervin,'\" another 2018 rap song fixated on acoustic loops. Just minutes later, he's the callous one on \"Skeezers\": \"I cheated on you with a dancer/ OK, I surrender, my hands up/ At least I admit it, I man up.\"\r\nSometimes you might want to hear the perspective of A Boogie's partners-in-heartbreak, and that's the gist of \"Come Closer,\" which sounds like a modern deconstruction of TLC's \"No Scrubs.\" It's a duet with the rising R&B singer Queen Naija, a rare woman to appear on a track with A Boogie. She's not quite as mean as he is \u2014 Him: \"If you lie, won't forgive you \u2026 And I won't ever, ever miss you;\" Her: \"So over your petty games, you're getting way too comfortable\" \u2014 though presumably she could get there with some practice. A whole album of songs like this would be fascinating in a voyeuristic way, like eavesdropping on another couple's therapy session. \r\nCan Hoodie SZN build on the unexpected national success of The Bigger Artist? In the run-up to his debut, A Boogie had several singles rising on the charts, but he's been almost entirely silent this year, with the exception of an eight-track duets release that sank without a trace. Meanwhile, other rappers have risen peddling a similar style. Lil Baby, who has amassed over two billion total streams across three different projects this year, released a track titled \"Close Friends\" that would fit easily next to several of A Boogie's romance-turned-sour records (try \"Still Think About You\" or \"Unhappy\"). Lil Tjay hails from the Bronx, just like A Boogie, and he employs similar vocal strategies on a recent string of SoundCloud hits. These artists' homage is a compliment, but it's also competition, a potential impediment to A Boogie's national breakthrough. \r\nBut earlier this year, Spotify shared data that revealed which artists were disproportionately favored by particular states. The winner in New York? A Boogie. Plenty of rappers before him proudly carved out careers with little more than that.", "pptitle": ["boogi", "wit", "da", "hoodi", "hoodi", "szn", "album", "review", "roll", "stone"]}
