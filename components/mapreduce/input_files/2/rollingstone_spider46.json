Sessions\r\nCapitol\r\n3.5 stars\r\n\r\nBrian Wilson once conceded that while\u00a0Pet Sounds\u00a0may be his best album,\u00a0Friends\u00a0was his favorite. Released in 1968, shortly after the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy, the supremely chill, transcendental-meditation-powered\u00a0Friends\u00a0LP was less beloved by record buyers. By\u00a0Beach\u00a0Boys\u00a0standards, it tanked, peaking at Number 126 on the Billboard charts, the band\u2019s lowest-ever LP rank. Perhaps, in the midst of so much cultural chaos, it didn\u2019t speak directly enough to the urgency of the time.\r\n\r\nListening to the\u00a0Friends\u00a0sessions 50 years later, in the midst of our current cultural chaos, it may be easier to hear the project\u2019s logic, and its beauty.\u00a0Wake the World: The Friends Sessions\u00a0and\u00a0I Can Hear Music: The 20/20 Sessions\u00a0are two of the latest entries in the band\u2019s annual vault-scraping to protect the copyright on unreleased material, which otherwise would expire after a half-century\u2019s time. (The band also released\u00a0On Tour: 1968\u00a0\u2014 100-plus tracks of live recordings from the period.)\r\n\r\nIssued straight to digital (though physical releases haven\u2019t been ruled out), the session sets are aimed at\u00a0Beach\u00a0Boys\u00a0superfans. But there\u2019s a broad appeal to these essentially deconstructed albums \u2014 issued apart from the final LPs, unlike most outtake collections \u2014 that makes them easy to dig, and lets the music be heard afresh. In the case of the\u00a0Friends\u00a0sessions,\u00a0this is partly because the finished album was a set of delicate miniatures; only two of its 12 songs clocked in above the three-minute mark. The title waltz, for instance, appears in this new release as kaleidoscopic instrumental for harmonica, vibraphone, strings, electric piano, a drum shuffle played with brushes, and more. It\u2019s followed by an a cappella version, the rising and descending harmonies in relief against a backdrop of churchlike silence. Taken together, they almost constitute an avant-garde remix. Three versions of \u201cTranscendental Meditation\u201d work together equally well \u2014 it\u2019s better and definitely weirder than the original. Almost all the included a cappellas are magical. After all, the\u00a0Beach\u00a0Boys\u2019 collective voices were a unique instrument \u2014 as if Stradivarius made a single violin \u2014 and hearing them isolated is a joy, almost regardless of what they\u2019re singing.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements are some of Brian Wilson\u2019s most interesting, with lovely international inflections. \u201cEven Steven,\u201d an early version of \u201cBusy Doin\u2019 Nothin\u2019,\u201d is an elegant bossa nova, like the final version, but taken at a slightly brisker tempo. The piano figure on an instrumental bit of \u201cAnna Lee the Healer\u201d (a song about the band\u2019s masseuse, apparently) sounds transposed from Joe Cuba\u2019s 1966 Latin boogaloo hit \u201cBang Bang,\u201d though the vibe is decidedly more chill. \u201cDiamond Head,\u201d with its slide guitar and ukulele, conjures Hawaiian music through the lens of Martin Denny-style exotica, but with more imagination.\r\n\r\nI Can Hear Music: The 20/20 Sessions\u00a0is less rich, perhaps because of Wilson\u2019s receding role. Two of the original album\u2019s highlights \u2014 \u201cOur Prayer\u201d and \u201cCabinessence\u201d \u2014 were 1966 outtakes from the aborted\u00a0Smile\u00a0project, and aren\u2019t represented here. Other standouts were covers: Ersel Hickey\u2019s 1958 \u201cBluebirds Over the Mountain\u201d (recently revived by Robert Plant and Chrissie Hynde) and the Ronettes\u2019 \u201cI Can Hear Music.\u201d The variants here are tasty, as are Wilson\u2019s dizzying high notes on the fragment of \u201cWalk on By.\u201d Burt Bacharach was a big influence on him at this point. Wilson\u2019s solo cover of Love\u2019s \u201cMy Little Red Book,\u201d another Bacharach-Hal David gem, appears on\u00a0Wake the World. It\u2019s long circulated as a bootleg, and spruced up here it\u2019s a marvel, veering from goofball high drama to heart-wrenching musicality and back in the space of a line or two. As a portrait of an unstable genius with his heart on his sleeve, it might be the most arresting thing here.\r\n\r\nHonorable mention goes to material written by brother Dennis Wilson, just beginning to come into his own as a songwriter. The a cappella of his \u201cLittle Bird\u201d and the remix of\u00a0\u00a0\u201cA Time to Live in Dreams\u201d are beautiful. So is \u201cNever Learn Not to Love,\u201d albeit in an unsettling way. Dennis had just gotten involved with the Manson family, and though Charles Manson isn\u2019t credited as co-writer, the song is generally accepted to be a revision of his \u201cCease to Exist.\u201d That backstory always highlighted the song\u2019s creepiness; the a cappella here brings it out even more.\r\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Dennis\u2019 trippy spoken-word excursion on a piece of tape titled \u201cThe Gong,\u201d teetering between what sounds like stoned studio hijinks and something scarier. (\u201cMaybe that\u2019s my problem: self destruction,\u201d he says at one point.) What\u2019s ultimately most fascinating about\u00a0Wake the World: The Friends Sessions\u00a0and\u00a0I Can Hear Music: The 20/20 Sessions, aside from how they put a magnifying glass on the band\u2019s mastery, is how the recordings humanize a group whose catalog is built on flawless pop gems \u2014 showing not only the seams in the construction, but crud and sweat and instability behind it all. Rather than undermining them, it makes the\u00a0Beach\u00a0Boys\u2019 accomplishments seem all the more impressive.", "pptitle": ["review", "beach", "boy", "plumb", "vault", "postpet", "sound", "gem", "roll", "stone"]}
