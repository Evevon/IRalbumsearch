Culled from the acoustic sets of Young\u2019s November 1976 tour with Crazy Horse, the two-dozen-plus songs on Songs for Judy find him ambling through his back and future catalog. He tries out newly written material like \u201cPocahontas\u201d and \u201cWhite Line,\u201d pleases the fans with faithful versions of \u201cHeart of Gold\u201d and \u201cAfter the Gold Rush,\u201d returns to his Buffalo Springfield days with an unplugged but still taut \u201cMr. Soul,\u201d and takes a few deep-cut forays; \u201cThe Losing End\u201d has never sounded more country-lonesome.\r\n\r\nBut that wide-ranging set list doesn\u2019t fully hint at the charm of Songs for Judy, which takes its title from its opening monologue: a seemingly stoned Young rambling on drolly about how he\u2019d spotted the late Judy Garland in the audience, who asked him about \u201cthe business.\u201d When he\u2019s singing and playing, Young sounds locked in as always\u2014check out the riveting unearthing of \u201cThe Old Laughing Lady\u201d here--but whether introducing songs or even in the middle of them, he\u2019s rarely sounded looser and more playful on a live record. He chides some of the crowd for being \u201casleep,\u201d dedicates \u201cMellow My Mind\u201d to critics, talks about not falling into the golden-oldies trap, and responds to a request for \u201cCountry Girl\u201d (from CSNY\u2019s D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu) by only singing a bit of it and claiming that\u2019s all he remembers. In terms of vituperative monologues, it\u2019s not quite Lou Reed\u2019s Take No Prisoners, but it\u2019s some of the loopier commentary captured on a live record from a major act.\r\n\r\nSongs for Judy also serves as an audio verite documentary on how arena-sized and sometimes out of control rock had become by the late \u201970s. Young gives a bemused shout-out to the \u201cloud, boisterous mothers out there,\u201d but he\u2019s not kidding; the crowds heard throughout the album sound even more lubricated than he may have been. They unleash lusty screams not only when he mentions \u201cdrugs and booze\u201d in \u201cToo Far Gone\u201d but even after he introduces a fragile version of \u201cHere We Are in the Years\u201d as \u201ckind of a quiet song.\u201d By comparison, Live at Massey Hall 1971, one of his earlier vault releases, sounds like a church recital, the audience politely applauding and listening throughout. Young had confronted similar scenarios on previous tours, including his 1974 stadium jaunt with CSNY, but Songs for Judy lets us join Young in experiencing rock\u2019s new world disorder.", "pptitle": ["review", "neil", "young", "latest", "archiv", "releas", "song", "judi", "roll", "stone"]}
