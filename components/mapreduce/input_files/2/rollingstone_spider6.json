But \u201cThe Weight of the Badge\u201d is a good-cop tribute that feels legit despite a whiff of Fox News human interest story. And \u201cGod and Country Music\u201d is a matter-of-fact spiritual that might soften hardboiled atheists \u2014 even if the charming kid\u2019s voice at the end (it belongs to Strait\u2019s grandson) feels like cheating. The song was penned by the power trio of Luke Laird, Barry Dean and Lori McKenna, and holds up an image of two patriarchs: Johnny Cash, beloved Christian progressive and tolerant empath, with his arm around Billy Graham, beloved Christian conservative, legacy homophobe and closet anti-Semite. It\u2019s an idealized vision of country\u2019s power to unite, and religion's. But good on Strait for pitching it. And the Lone Star soul in the chorus \u2014 the way he shoots into his upper register on \u201cthere\u2019s always lost in the found/Darkness in the \u2018I saw the light\u2019\u201d like a Blue Angels squadron while invoking two country gospel cornerstones\u00a0 \u2014 is magnificent by any measure.\r\n\r\nThe highlights elsewhere include top-shelf boilerplate honky-tonkin\u2019: see the Hank Williams-invoking \u201cEvery Little Honky Tonk Bar\u201d and the rock\u2019n\u2019rollin\u2019 \u201cHonky Tonk Time Machine.\u201d There\u2019s some Bob Wills Tex-Mex swing (\u201cCodigo\u201d) and a lonesome Johnny Paycheck cover (\u201cOld Violin\u201d). The duet \u201cSing One With Willie,\u201d a sort of second cousin to Toby Keith\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Never Smoke Weed With Willie Again,\u201d wraps things up with a smirk. It\u2019s a half-baked love song between two old Texas legends who are as different as Cash and Graham, but unified by country music. These days, we all need to find common ground where we can.", "pptitle": ["review", "georg", "strait", "oldschool", "countri", "flashback", "honki", "tonk", "time", "machin", "roll", "stone"]}
