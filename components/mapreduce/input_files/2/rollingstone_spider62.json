Even when it seems like she\u2019s at a career low (the underrated commercial calamity\u00a0Glitter)), she comes back swinging for the next round.\r\n\r\nCaution\u00a0comes four years after\u00a0Me. I Am Mariah...The Elusive Chanteuse, a solid album that lacked the vocal consistency and musical cohesion of her best work, despite re-teaming Carey with frequent collaborator Jermaine Dupri. In the four years since that album, Carey embarked the heaviest touring of her career, focused on her Christmas empire, went to Vegas and solidified an iconic Instagram presence. Some time away proved smart:\u00a0Caution\u00a0is pure hip-hop-leaning pop bliss, on par with post-Glitter\u00a0and\u00a0Charmbracelet\u00a0comeback tour-de-force\u00a0Emancipation of Mimi\u00a0in how it both sublimely nods to current trends while reaffirming the singer-songwriter as a formidable pop presence.\u00a0Caution\u00a0is thrillingly current without swallowing Carey\u2019s charm (even though that seems increasingly more and more impossible for a star like her).\r\n\r\nLaunching with the aptly-titled, soothingly sassy \u201cGTFO,\u201d it\u2019s clear Carey has set her mode to \u201csavage\u201d for this project. Sure there are love songs and moments of inward reflection, but the majority of the tracks are kiss-offs aimed at those who have doubted her or left her scorned. Take the No ID-assisted title track: \u201cProceed with caution/Don\u2019t be dishonest/I need you closer/To love me harder,\u201d she requests. On the \u201cCrush on You\u201d-sampling \u201cA No No\u201d \u2014 a highlight for both this album and R&B this year \u2014 she delivers sly diss after diss, all accented with a sweet but stern \u201cno.\u201d In true Elusive Chanteuse form, she takes it to another level by the song\u2019s end: \u201cParlez-vous francais? I said no/Lemme translate it: I said no/ I can say it en espanol/No.\u201d On the Timbaland collab \u201c8th Grade,\u201d she suggests to an uncertain, negligent lover that \u201cMaybe the lyrics were too heavy in my song.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen she\u2019s not on a strategic lyrical warpath, Carey delivers sexy, midtempo love songs like the Blood Orange-produced \u201cGiving Me Life,\u201d which has her turning fan twitter language into cooing, personal sweet nothings. Skrillex and Poo Bear produced \u201cThe Distance,\u201d somehow simultaneously both a diss and a love song, celebrates the success of her love story while throwing a perfectly-manicured middle-finger at the non-believers.\r\n\r\nVocally, Carey draws back from the octave rollercoaster she's been taking people on for decades. She nestles into the strong warmth of a softer delivery, appropriate for the slow-burning R&B sound of the album. Now and again, a hint of her famous whistle register and signature, city-filling belting sneak up for emphasis, like on the shchmaltzy slow jam \"With You,\" where that whistle sneaks up in the background as the song progresses.\r\n\r\nWhile big, emotional ballads were the groundwork of Carey\u2019s early years, there is only one truly heavy moment on the album: final song \u201cPortrait.\u201d Following the lyrical curves, R&B coos and stellar production, it\u2019s a starkly heavy moment that feels like a throwback to a bygone era of power ballads for vocalists of her caliber. On the song, Carey reveals the inner emotional tension of having her own crosses to bear but wanting to keep them hidden from the world. \u201cAnd for the finale she can float around effortlessly/And dream away the hours in her mind,\u201d she sings on the dreamy, twinkling bridge. It\u2019s an honest end to an honest album, full of truths and delivered as only she can.", "pptitle": ["review", "mariah", "carey", "stay", "current", "lose", "charm", "caution", "roll", "stone"]}
