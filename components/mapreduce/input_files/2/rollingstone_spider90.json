Finally, many of us collectively thought: the real Black Eyed Peas are back, the true-school trio who once turned heads with their well-received 1998 debut Behind the Front. And they finally got rid of \u201cthe white girl\u201d\u2014the racially-tinged epithet some use to denigrate former member Fergie, who helped launch the group to superstardom when she joined in 2002. As they assert on their new album Masters of the Sun, \u201cOne plus one plus one is three/Classic Black Eyed Peas.\u201d (Fergie, for her part, seems to have left on good terms.)\r\n\r\nHowever, the original Peas was very much a product of the late 90s, when hip-hop ascetics like Common, the Roots and Black Star mounted a brief but inspired counterrevolution against the rising commercial tide of Roc-A-Fella, Bad Boy, and No Limit. They weren\u2019t as lyrically innovative as Mos Def, nor as musically indelible as Q-Tip and Slum Village, and despite inspired moments like \u201cJoints + Jam\u201d those first two Fergie-less albums didn\u2019t yield much classic material. Their subsequent shift from middlebrow backpackers to shameless poptimists may have branded them as sellouts; but at least they learned to craft hooky, unforgettable songs, whether for better (\u201cLike That,\u201d their underrated 2004 track with Q-Tip and Cee-Lo) or worse (uh, \u201cMy Humps\u201d).\r\n\r\nDoes Masters of the Sun capture the best of both Peas incarnations \u2013 the universal B-boy aesthetic and the undeniable postmillennial pop songcraft \u2013 while cutting out the snoozy neo-soul vibes of the former and those annoying, lowest-comon-denominator earworms? It\u2019s a steep task. Since quietly fading away after a sales disappointment in 2010\u2019s The Beginning and a disastrous Super Bowl XLV appearance, newer voices have claimed their spot. Logic and Macklemore make the same kind of earnestly positive pop-rap the Black Eyed Peas once specialized in, while Childish Gambino deploys the kind of subversive edge they once used on singles like \u201cFallin\u2019 Down.\u201d Hip-hop has moved on since \u201cBoom Boom Pow,\u201d and while there is much to like on Masters of the Sun, it also feels like an attempt to return to an earlier golden era that doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\r\n\r\nTo their credit, Will, Apl.de.Ap and Taboo embrace their status as elder statesmen. Like a veteran DJ digging into the nooks and crannies of his crates, Will speckles his beats with old-school notes. The spoken-word sample from Boogie Down Productions\u2019 \u201cMy Philosophy\u201d appears on \u201cYES or NO,\u201d a track that reflects the uncompromising energy of progressive activism. Nas shows up on \u201cBack 2 Hip-Hop,\u201d as does the voice of Slick Rick\u2019s \u201cLa-Di-Da-Di\u201d on \u201cConstant Pt. 1 Pt. 2.\u201d Best of all, a verse Phife Dawg recorded before his 2016 death \u2013 as well as guests Posdnous from De La Soul and Ali Shaheed Muhammad anchors the organic soul groove of \u201cAll Around the World.\u201d \u201cWe on that award tour with Muhammad again/50-city run with Black Eyed Peas and them,\u201d raps Phife in that familiar, much-missed Jamaica Queens lilt.\r\n\r\nAs always, Will adds a sentimental pop buoyancy to these cuts. Nearly every track features an emotional singing voice, whether it\u2019s Jessica Reynoso wailing \u201cget ready\u201d on \u201cYES or NO,\u201d Esthero trilling lightly on \u201c4EVER,\u201d or Nicole Scherzinger interpolating Bette Midler\u2019s \u201cWind Beneath My Wings\u201d for \u201cWings.\u201d For \u201cConstant,\u201d he shifts the beat from a chirpy b-boy groove to a thrilling juke/house glissando. The \u201cPart 2\u201d of \u201cConstant\u201d has drawn the ire of UK producer Lone, who claims Will plagiarized one of his tracks. Fairly or unfairly, it\u2019s a charge the Peas leader has faced through much of his career.\r\n\r\nLyrically, the Peas have never dazzled, but they studiously add context to each of these pop-rap numbers. \u201cI\u2019m out for the night, smile for the lights/Looking for a taste and I end up with a slice,\u201d rhymes Taboo on \u201c4EVER.\u201d They all sound in good spirits on Masters of the Sun. Of course, they\u2019ll never escape the legacy of those massive early Aughts chart-toppers, and recent concerts suggest fans want to hear \u201cI Gotta Feeling,\u201d not classic Black Eyed Peas. But life goes on for one of the most critically-divisive groups of their era, even if the modestly engaging Masters of the Sun proves that, as the saying goes, you can\u2019t really go home again.", "pptitle": ["review", "black", "eye", "pea", "want", "poprap", "elder", "statesmen", "master", "sun", "roll", "stone"]}
