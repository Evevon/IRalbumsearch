But what set Daughters apart was the unnerving nature of their menace \u2014 you truly didn\u2019t know what frontman Alexis Marshall might say or do. The band regrouped five years ago and have tweaked their sound slightly;\u00a0You Won\u2019t Get What You Want\u00a0is a slow build rather than a shrieking onslaught, but it still has an inherent sense of danger. The band\u2019s most obvious influences (chiefly Jesus Lizard and the Birthday Party) are still present, but they\u2019ve been transmogrified through electronics, tribal drumming and Marshall\u2019s meandering moans. On \u201cLong Road No Turns,\u201d the music seems to melt around Marshall\u2019s voice as he sings about shackled wrists; \u201cThe Reason They Hate Me\u201d is a lumbering, industrial dance song; \u201cGuest House\u201d is a percussion showcase that adds one texture over another as Marshall sings, \u201cLet me in.\u201d If heavy music is supposed to be scary, Daughters have elevated it to an invigorating new level.", "pptitle": ["review", "daughter", "wont", "want", "roll", "stone"]}
