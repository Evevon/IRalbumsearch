0.11278440794569825, "content": "\nIn early 1972, Marvin Gaye should have been on top of the world. The previous year, he had wrested control of his career from Motown\u2019s draconian hit-making system, winning a bitter battle to get What\u2019s Going On released as a single: the song Motown boss Berry Gordy claimed was \u201cthe worst piece of crap I ever heard\u201d spent five weeks at No 1 in the US R&B chart. The album of the same name had sold a million copies, been nominated for two Grammys and redefined perceptions of Motown both externally and internally. A label previously dominated by singles had released a critically acclaimed, wildly successful concept album. An emboldened Stevie Wonder was now making it clear that he too was sick of the label\u2019s insistence on total control. In the wake of What\u2019s Going On, Gaye had been named trendsetter of the year by Billboard magazine, and re-signed with Motown in what was, at the time, the most lucrative deal ever struck by a black artist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Marvin Gaye: You\u2019re the Man album artwork\n\n\nBut, as was invariably the case in Gaye\u2019s complex and troubled life, all was not as it seemed. Just as the 1968 success of I Heard It Through the Grapevine had left him oddly resentful and insecure \u2013 he hadn\u2019t written the song, so he \u201cfelt like a puppet\u201d \u2013 and he found the acclaim afforded What\u2019s Going On \u201cheavy\u201d. As he told biographer David Ritz: \u201cWhen you\u2019re at the top there\u2019s nowhere to go but down.\u201d And his battle with Motown wasn\u2019t over. When Gordy heard Gaye\u2019s next single, You\u2019re the Man \u2013 a bleak, distrustful assessment of the 1972 US presidential campaign, intended as the title track of a forthcoming album but lacking the kind of luscious melodies that had flowed through What\u2019s Going On \u2013 he either panicked or coolly enacted revenge for Gaye\u2019s earlier revolt: Motown pulled promotion and pressured radio stations to drop it from their playlists, ensuring it flopped.\nThis 17-track collection named after that song tries to make sense of what happened next. Grandly billed as a great lost album, it\u2019s really a compilation of cancelled singles and studio outtakes, some of them polished up for release by Amy Winehouse producer Salaam Remi. They capture the sound of an artist who clearly doesn\u2019t know what to do. At some sessions, Gaye forged ahead with the idea of another album in the socially conscious vein of What\u2019s Going On. He reworked You\u2019re the Man in the hazy, shimmering style of that album, and recorded Woman of the World \u2013 an ostensibly breezy ode to feminism that on closer inspection seems to be grousing that women\u2019s lib is interfering with the more important business of Marvin Gaye getting his leg over. The fantastic The World Is Rated X similarly suggests that his attitude had become more cynical than that of the saintly figure pleading we Save the Children a year previously.\nAt other sessions, however, Gaye behaved as though he thought Gordy might have had a point, meekly returning to Motown business as usual. He taped a series of songs with Willie Hutch, subsequently best known for his blaxploitation soundtracks to The Mack and Foxy Brown, but then a Motown staff writer. To say what they recorded is standard-issue lightweight early 70s Motown pop would be underselling it slightly \u2013 I\u2019m Gonna Give You Respect is a fabulous, effervescent song, and Gaye gives it his all \u2013 but it\u2019s a world away from Inner City Blues or What\u2019s Happening Brother. But another song by staffers, Gloria Jones and Pamela Sawyer\u2019s Piece of Clay, is inspired, its gospel sound spattered with a howling psychedelic guitar: soul\u2019s past tied together with its present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  \u2018Soul\u2019s past tied together with its present\u2019 ... Gaye in the early 1970s. Photograph: Gems/Redferns\n\n\nElsewhere, You\u2019re the Man unearths a cache of great unreleased ballads from 1969, of which Symphony is both the best song and a reminder of the perils of letting a hot producer loose on old material. Apparently working on the demented principle that Gaye\u2019s work would be improved if it sounded as if it was recorded last week, Salaam Remi has faffed with the drums to give them a contemporary feel. If his approach is marginally more subtle than the late-80s practice of just whacking a drum machine on top of a vintage track, it\u2019s clearly going to date in a way the original recording \u2013 released in 2009 on the deluxe edition of Gaye\u2019s 1973 album Let\u2019s Get It On \u2013 has not.\n\n\n\n\n'An ad for blackness': how Soul Train made America do the Hustle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaye found his route out of confusion by unlikely means, recording a Christmas single that Motown declined to release. Understandably so: I Want to Come Home for Christmas was a desolate slab of misery written from the perspective of a prisoner of war, while Christmas in the City was a funereal-paced synthesiser instrumental. But the latter prefigured Gaye\u2019s hit soundtrack to Trouble Man, just as Woman of the World\u2019s suggestion that politics mattered less to Gaye than sex prefigured Let\u2019s Get It On. The music he abandoned in order to release those albums is a fascinating jumble of ideas, some of them fantastic. Too confused to be a great lost album, or indeed a coherent collection, as a snapshot of both its creator and soul music in turmoil, it\u2019s perfect.\n\n\n\nThis week Alexis listened to\nJakob Leventhal: This Love Is SarcasticFrom an eight-track debut mini album, a beautiful, classy and classic slice of singer-songwriting that unfolds from acoustic intimacy to lush Beach Boys harmonies.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n\n\nAlexis Petridis's album of the week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarvin Gaye\n\n\n\n\nSoul\n\n\n\n\nR&B\n\n\n\n\nMotown records\n\n\n\n\nreviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["marvin", "gay", "your", "man", "review", "lost", "album", "crossroad", "soul", "alexi", "petridiss", "album", "week", "music", "guardian"]}
