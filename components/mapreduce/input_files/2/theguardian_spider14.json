It\u2019s not just the title track, a lament for the hard lives of the Highlanders in a tiny village that is now \u201ca ruined monument to life and death\u201d. It\u2019s there in Outside, in which fuzzed, frantic Ramones guitars are accompanied by a lyric repeating that band\u2019s old mantra of \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d. But it\u2019s not the defiance of youth that makes him uncaring: \u201cNow I\u2019m old, I don\u2019t care.\u201d That theme is picked up on Glasgow to London, on which Collins reflects on how there was a time \u201cAmbition drove my life / Now I\u2019m old I must admit I couldn\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Edwyn Collins: Badbea album artwork\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not to say this is a recorded equivalent of one of those Grumpy Old Men talking heads\u2019 shows on TV. Even when Collins is excoriating selfishness on It\u2019s All About You, he does so with the same arch beauty he employed back in the Orange Juice days: \u201cThe sun was a bright bikini yellow / The sky was a Wedgwood blue / The mood was unspeakably mellow / When you came and spoilt the view.\u201d You couldn\u2019t call Badbea wildly original; it\u2019s filled with references to Collins\u2019s musical touchstones (northern soul; the Velvet Underground) and an explicit melodic link to Big Star\u2019s Feel in I\u2019m OK Jack. But Collins is in fine voice, and it\u2019s always a pleasure to have him back. \n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nEdwyn Collins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop and rock\n\n\n\n\nPunk\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["edwyn", "collin", "badbea", "review", "arch", "punk", "provocateur", "age", "defiantli", "music", "guardian"]}
