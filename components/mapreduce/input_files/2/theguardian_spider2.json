At first, her thoughtful acoustic songwriting shared some of her early collaborators Bombay Bicycle Club\u2019s ornate indie twee; later, it came to breathe a little as she explored southern soul on her 2017 album Something\u2019s Changing, her first release as an independent artist after negotiating her way out of her old major label deal. She toured South America alone, liaising direct with fans to arrange gigs and accommodation, and reclaimed control over her career.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a narrative from which empowerment parables are made, but Rose found herself wracked by a loss of purpose and identity in the aftermath. Her fourth album, No Words Left, is her starkest, filled with lyrics about uncertainty and isolation, and yet her most striking, conveying the strongest sense of her artistic identity yet.This time, Rose\u2019s candid, searching songwriting is the focus, buoyed by soft piano, gentle acoustic fingerpicking and subtly deployed strings and brass. The production dwells more on texture and intensity than obvious stylistic signposting: the ending of Solo(w), a forlorn song with the integrity of an early Kate Bush ballad, seems to bloom with yearning, while a silvery glow stirs on The Confines of This World, in which Rose steadily introduces choppiness to the electric guitar and bite to her voice to convey her interior tumult. The fluid, intuitive arrangements let her melodies shine \u2013 the tumbling chorus of Save Me from Your Kindness conveys her sheer sense of desolation \u2013 and leave space for her tentative delivery to work as an appealing feature rather than a shortcoming.And, in an age where every artist is singing about their anxieties, the rawness of her admissions stand out: \u201cI\u2019m terrified that these things won\u2019t ever change, for all of my life\u201d she sings on Treat Me Like a Woman, a song that manages to swoon and hold its nerve. On Song After Song, she confesses that a friend\u2019s comfort is wasted on her enduring inferiority complex. The bleak and beautiful No Words Left should go some way to mitigating it.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nLucy Rose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndie\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["luci", "rose", "word", "left", "review", "starkest", "strike", "album", "music", "guardian"]}
