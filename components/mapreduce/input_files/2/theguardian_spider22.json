The past three years have seen him grow from underground street-freestyling sensation to truly versatile artist. Psychodrama is his debut long-player, following a series of singles and EPs that showed him equally adept at ripping through frantic grime singles, pained memoirs, blissed-out summer anthems and seven-minute-plus reflections on the failings of the political class.\n\n\n\n\nDave: \u2018Black is confusing\u2026 where does the line start and stop?\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFramed loosely around the idea that the 20-year-old is in therapy for everything he\u2019s been through, Pyschodrama\u2019s 11 tracks flip from the mellow and intricate Afrobeats love song Location, with Nigerian superstar Burna Boy, to recent single Black, a powerful reflection on the black British experience \u2013 spanning African diasporic pride and the weight of post-colonial pain and racism. There\u2019s a lot of piano (Dave is grade 7), a lot of weariness about the \u201cbattle scars\u201d of growing up in Streatham with two brothers in jail, and a lot of wariness about success, trust and betrayal.\nIt all culminates in Lesley, a staggering, 11-minute exploration of toxic masculinity and domestic abuse. \u201cTell a yout\u2019, if you got a brain then use it,\u201d he raps, early on; Dave\u2019s doing that, but has much more in his armoury than just brains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nWatch the video for Black, from Psychodrama.\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nRap\n\n\n\n\nThe Observer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["dave", "psychodrama", "review", "debut", "longplay", "doesnt", "disappoint", "music", "guardian"]}
