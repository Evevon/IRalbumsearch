To Build a Home \u2013 a spare and exquisitely beautiful piano ballad featuring the Canadian musician Patrick Watson \u2013 has become a TV score standard in the decade since its release, soundtracking a slew of blockbuster dramas. Yet while the song\u2019s ethereal melancholy has proven enduring, its makers have dipped out of view in the intervening years. To Build a Home was the opening track on the Cinematic Orchestra\u2019s 2007 record Ma Fleur \u2013 until now, the last proper album they released.\nThat makes To Believe a comeback of sorts, an opportunity for the 20-year-old group to restate their relevance. To those ends, Swinscoe has described the album as a contemplation on belief in the age of Brexit. Yet while the verbose track titles hint at lofty ideas, the songs don\u2019t so much pin down and interrogate our modern malaise as transpose it into wilful abstraction. Sonically, meanwhile, the topic leads the group to set up camp in the space between their second and third albums \u2013 the former ominous, jazzy, trip-hop-informed; the latter a prettier, more wistful collection of featured-artist crooning. At one end of the spectrum is A Caged Bird/Imitations of Life, which sees the group reunite with Roots Manuva \u2013 who guested on their edgy, expansive 2002 track All Things to All Men \u2013 for a mellower collaboration. To Believe\u2019s titular opener, a pared-down vehicle for Moses Sumney\u2019s soft, airy and soaring vocal, cleaves most closely to Ma Fleur\u2019s style, but can\u2019t quite recapture its muted majesty.\nThe main problem with To Believe, however, is that by combining two of their previous styles, the Cinematic Orchestra have landed on a sound that has become ubiquitous in the years they\u2019ve been away \u2013 portentous, restrained and impeccably tasteful electronica. With that in mind, this is an album that feels accomplished but unremarkable, neither possessing the kind of experimentalism that might push things forward nor idiosyncratic enough to stand out in a newly crowded marketplace.\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectronic music\n\n\n\n\nPop and rock\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["cinemat", "orchestra", "believ", "review", "soundscap", "origin", "accomplish", "return", "music", "guardian"]}
