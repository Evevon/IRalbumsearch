The album If (Signum Classics) is a fresh and delicate collaboration with the excellent viol group Fretwork, as versatile in their own way as Davies. Songs by Purcell are set alongside those by Nyman, long associated with the music of 17th-century England through his soundtrack for The Draughtsman\u2019s Contract (1982). Purcell\u2019s Evening Hymn showcase Davies\u2019s famed vocal purity, but so too does the exquisite title song, Nyman\u2019s If, from the soundtrack to 1995 Japanese animation The Diary of Anne Frank. Nyman\u2019s extended energetic instrumental piece Music After a While is an imaginative foil to Purcell\u2019s ethereal Music for a While. Anyone who thinks Nyman\u2019s music stops at his hallmark pulsing rhythms and prominent bass lines will find variety and introspective beauty here, all executed with perfection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nWatch an album trailer for If.\n\n\n\u2022 Chamber music by Nyman\u2019s near contemporary fellow British composer Nigel Osborne is the focus of Sensations of Travel by the Hebrides Ensemble (Delphian). Based in Edinburgh but an intrepid traveller, Osborne has spent time in war zones in the Balkans and in Syria, pioneering his own form of music therapy. Some of that experience is reflected here, each work a tiny drama capturing these far-off landscapes. Balkan Dances and Laments, with its dense rhythms and weeping oboe song, echoes Bosnian music. My beloved, where are you going \u2013 Adagio for Vedra is a heartfelt piece for Osborne\u2019s friend Vedra Smailovi\u0107, \u201ca cellist with frostbitten fingers\u201d who played for the Sarajevo Opera. The Piano Tuner \u2013 three preludes and five fugues for piano trio \u2013 reworks material from Osborne\u2019s opera based on the novel by Daniel Mason about the tuning of an Erard piano in the colonial Burmese jungle. The six-strong Hebrides Ensemble has immersed itself deeply and winningly in Osborne\u2019s eclectic sound world.\n\u2022 In The Frontline Music Therapist (BBC Sounds), broadcast on the World Service\u2019s Outlook, Nigel Osborne talks about his work in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the musicians he worked with. It\u2019s a good place to start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nWatch the Hebrides Ensemble\u2019s Will Conway, Huw Watkins and Z\u00f6e Beyers perform The Piano Tuner by Nigel Osborne.\n\n\n This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
