0.147452667064736, "content": "\nAmid the round of interviews to promote These New Puritans\u2019 fourth studio album, an intriguing detail emerged. At some juncture during its lengthy gestation, George Barnett \u2013 who with his twin brother Jack now comprises These New Puritans, once a four-piece \u2013 had assured the band\u2019s record label that what they were working on was \u201cthe most commercial thing ever\u201d. This, for anyone with a passing knowledge of the band\u2019s output over the last decade, would constitute a fairly dramatic shift in priorities. On arrival they seemed the archetypal mid-2000s indie band: in debt to post-punk, good with a provocative interview quote, and with a sideline in collaborating on Hedi Slimane\u2019s Dior Homme catwalk shows.\n\n\n\nThen things took an unexpected turn. Their second album, 2010\u2019s Hidden, offered up Japanese taiko drums, martial-sounding blasts of electronics and orchestrations influenced by modern classical composer and jazz pianist Richard Rodney Bennett. By the time of 2013\u2019s extraordinary Field of Reeds \u2013 with its beautiful, serpentine songs, Portuguese fado singing, recording of a live hawk swooping across the studio, arrangements so complex that the classical musicians hired to play them apparently balked \u2013 people were talking about Jack Barnett in the same breath as Talk Talk\u2019s late mastermind Mark Hollis. That\u2019s partly because Talk Talk\u2019s swansong, Laughing Stock, was one of the few albums to which it seemed to bear even a vague comparison; partly because, like Hollis, Barnett seemed to be engaged in a painstaking personal musical quest that paid zero interest to commercial expectations.\nSo when considering the possibility that its follow-up might be \u201cthe most commercial thing ever\u201d, it\u2019s best to remember that such things are relative. This is, after all, an album that features a guest appearance from David Tibet, mastermind behind the endlessly fascinating post-industrial institution Current 93, on its first single Into the Fire. Nothing says vast mainstream appeal quite like a collab with a man who once started a religious cult dedicated to worshipping the children\u2019s character Noddy and invariably sounds less like he\u2019s singing than incanting prior to conducting a human sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nThese New Puritans: Inside the Rose \u2013 video\n\n\nStill, in a certain light, you can see what George Barnett means. While its three predecessors departed from each other so radically they might as well have been the work of different bands, Inside the Rose feels like a progression from Field of Reeds. The songs still tend to take the scenic route, coming packed with musical ideas \u2013 in opener Infinity Vibraphones alone, you get the titular instrument playing a complex, Steve Reich-influenced pattern, strings, a punishing electronic bass pulse, backing vocals that sound inspired by Gregorian chants and drums that feel both militaristic and influenced by the cut-up breaks of drum\u2019n\u2019bass. There\u2019s a distinct sense of a band informed by a desire for musical adventure: \u201cLet this music be a kind of paradise, a kind of nightmare, a kind of I don\u2019t care,\u201d sings Barnett on A-R-P, a particularly lovely shimmer of strings and electronics that unexpectedly slips into rattling 180pm breakbeat in its final minute.\n\n\n\n\nMusicians on Mark Hollis: 'He found hooks in places I'm still trying to fathom'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNevertheless, some of Field of Reeds\u2019 more rococo flourishes have been pared back \u2013 no basso profundo opera singers or indeed live birds of prey \u2013 leaving the songs, and Jack Barnett\u2019s voice, more room to breathe. The latter is a revelation, largely because, at some point in the last six years, he seems to have learned to sing. The fragility of his buried vocals on Field of Reeds was part of the album\u2019s appeal, but here they\u2019re front and centre: still occasionally too smeared to decipher, but possessed of a powerful, yearning quality unheard in These New Puritans\u2019 output to date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nThese New Puritans: Where the Trees Are on Fire \u2013 video\n\n\nThey fit with the album\u2019s lyrical theme, which \u2013 as far as you can make out \u2013 seems to be love. There\u2019s a lot of stuff about abandoning yourself, giving in, not knowing where you\u2019re going, but heading off anyway. It\u2019s possible that Where the Trees Are on Fire is some kind of ecologically minded lament, but the musical backdrop sounds too lush and enveloping and, eventually, as the drums kick in, too euphoric. It\u2019s also, in its own weird way, incredibly catchy: the two cyclical lines of melody burn themselves into your brain, as does the breezy, endlessly repeated guitar hook of Anti-Gravity, or the motif delivered by a clear, chorister-like voice on the largely instrumental closer Six.\n\n\n\n\nSign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it\u2019s not by any stretch of the imagination \u201cthe most commercial thing ever\u201d, Inside the Rose is certainly more direct in its approach than Field of Reeds, but its directness doesn\u2019t preclude a real richness and depth, a willingness to take risks and an ability to collage disparate musical ideas together into a coherent whole. There are moments when you think it\u2019s not beyond the realm of possibility that it might reach a wider audience than These New Puritans have previously captured, but that seems beside the point: it feels less like a lunge for the charts than another stopping point on an increasingly fascinating musical journey.\nThis week Alexis listened to\nDJ Rocca: PenneOne of three pasta-themed tracks of the Italian producer\u2019s new EP, Penne is impressively hard to pin down: breakbeat, acid-y, Sheffield techno-ish bass, 80s boogie synths, jazz flute solo.
