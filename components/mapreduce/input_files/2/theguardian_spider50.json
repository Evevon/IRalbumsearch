Dave\u2019s most recent single Black is startling. When the follow-up to his 2018 No 1 Funky Friday was added to the Radio 1 playlist, it provoked a deluge of complaints from listeners: enough that breakfast show host Greg James felt obliged to address the issue on air, while Annie Mac defended the song on Twitter. The startling thing is that Black isn\u2019t the kind of rap track that people normally get upset about: the standard bugbears of violence, misogyny or homophobia are nowhere to be heard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Dave: Psychodrama album artwork\n\n\nInstead, it\u2019s a complex, intelligent examination of racial identity that puzzles at the blanket use of the word \u201cblack\u201d to describe a multitude of different ethnicities, that rails against institutionalised racism and cultural appropriation but doesn\u2019t shy away from pointing out failings within the rapper\u2019s own community. To judge by Annie Mac\u2019s response, there has been a hint of \u201cactually, all lives matter\u201d about the criticism the track engendered. \u201cIf you are genuinely offended by a man talking about the colour of his skin and how it\u2019s shaped his identity,\u201d she said, \u201cthen that is a problem for you.\u201d\nIt\u2019s baffling and depressing: an artist who genuinely has something to say being shouted down for saying it. But, if nothing else, the fact that Dave chose to trail his long-awaited debut album with a single like Black tells you a lot about the album itself. His path to success has been the standard one followed by British rappers in recent years: exposure on SBTV and Radio 1Xtra, self-released singles and EPs, the inevitable co-sign from Drake. But, despite its guest appearances from J Hus, Burna Boy and Ruelle, Psychodrama is an album that seems intent on setting a degree of distance between Dave and his peers. It\u2019s structured as a kind of concept album, with songs linked by spoken-word sections ostensibly featuring the rapper\u2019s psychotherapist. Its centrepiece, Lesley, isn\u2019t a previous hit \u2013 the string of singles that preceded Black are noticeable by their absence \u2013 but an 11-minute track that depicts an abusive relationship and its shattering fallout in harrowing detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nDave: Black \u2013 video\n\n\nDespite the presence of hit-making producer Fraser T Smith \u2013 who progressed from knocking together the pop-rap singles that brought Tinchy Stryder success a decade ago to helming Stormzy\u2019s Gang Signs & Prayer \u2013 the album\u2019s sound is spare and sullen, its beats lightly decorated with moody piano figures and ghostly snatches of warped vocals, its tone unsparingly downbeat and sombre. Even the most pop-facing track, the ostensibly romantic Voices, comes replete with intimations of paranoia and mental illness. There are chinks of light about the music on Purple Heart, or the Drake-esque Location, but you\u2019d never describe them as party-starting bangers.\nMoreover, those tracks serve largely as a brief moment of respite between plunges into bleak, street-level reportage. Streatham casts an unsentimental eye over the rapper\u2019s youth; Screwface Capital starts out swaggering about success and sexual prowess, but becomes increasingly dark and despairing, unable to shake off the ghosts of the past, before the lyrics crash to a halt. The last minute and a half is entirely instrumental, given over to a haunting, jazzy keyboard solo, as if the rapper can\u2019t face talking any more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Dave performing at Wireless festival, 8 July 2017. Photograph: Burak \u00c7\u0131ng\u0131/Redferns\n\n\nThe concluding Drama features a recording of a telephone conversation lauding Dave\u2019s commercial success, but the person speaking is the rapper\u2019s older brother, calling from prison, where he\u2019s currently serving a life sentence for his involvement in the murder of Sofyen Belamouadden at Victoria Station in 2010. The ensuing track is constructed as a kind of dialogue between the siblings, Dave raging at his brother \u2013 \u201cI lost the only person I ever fucking idolised\u201d \u2013 and recounting the complex psychological impact of his conviction, emotional shut-down chafing against a firing of determination: \u201cI don\u2019t have a vision of a marriage or a wedding ring / World domination in music or it ain\u2019t anything.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDave: \u2018Black is confusing\u2026 where does the line start and stop?\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the face of it, Psychodrama seems a strange way to go about achieving the latter: unvarnished and emotionally raw, it frequently makes for tough listening. Equally, as a showcase for Dave\u2019s talents, it unquestionably works. His lyrics are smart, thoughtful, unflinching and self-aware. In a world where artists seem terrified of their audience hitting the fast-forward button, of skipping to the next song on the streaming service playlist, it\u2019s a big ask to confront listeners with an 11-minute rap track, especially when the subject matter is as unremittingly grim as that of Lesley, but it\u2019s genuinely gripping. Indeed, it says something about how incisive Dave is as a writer that the album lasts for the best part of an hour, and not a minute of its running time seems wasted or padded out. The end result is certainly the boldest album to emerge from UK hip-hop\u2019s renaissance. It may also be the best. However big its ambitions, Dave has the talent to fulfil them.\n\n\n\nThis week Alexis listened to\nCrumb: Part IIIDrifting psych-pop in two parts, the new single by NY quartet Crumb sounds pleasingly like the work of Broadcast\u2019s distant UK cousins.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n\n\nAlexis Petridis's album of the week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRap\n\n\n\n\nHip-hop\n\n\n\n\nreviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["dave", "psychodrama", "review", "boldest", "best", "british", "rap", "album", "gener", "alexi", "petridiss", "album", "week", "music", "guardian"]}
