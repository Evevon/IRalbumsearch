It\u2019s not blues in the sense of adopting the 12-bar shuffle, more that it draws on the themes that have affected her as a woman of colour in the south: race, religion (she was raised in the Seventh-day Adventist church), powerlessness and oppression. Silences, her second album, traces those ideas through the story of one woman experiencing them, though \u2013 as with most themed albums \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t necessarily know that unless you\u2019d been told.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Adia Victoria: Silences album artwork\n\n\nWhat is apparent, though, is the way Victoria twists the themes of the blues into new shapes, asserting her protagonist\u2019s need for agency, a need that extends beyond earthly confines: \u201cFirst of all / There is no God / Because I killed my God,\u201d she sings on the opener, Clean. \u201cI killed him clean / So it did not hurt.\u201d By Dope Queen Blues, she\u2019s found divinity within herself: \u201cI had a thought: I am a god / Of this I am convinced.\u201d Her musical settings have evolved since her early singles and debut album, Beyond the Bloodhounds. Silences adds horns, woodwind and electronics to a guitar-band set-up, and Victoria and co-producer Aaron Dessner twist it all appealingly. They set her calm voice against backings that suggest turmoil without ever over-egging things, from the slinky rock\u2019n\u2019roll of Different Kind of Love to the spectral balladry of the closer, Get Lonely. It\u2019s all a bit wonderful, actually.\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop and rock\n\n\n\n\nBlues\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["adia", "victoria", "silenc", "review", "compel", "southern", "gothic", "blue", "music", "guardian"]}
