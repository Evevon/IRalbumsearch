It\u2019s one of six sonatinas in this highly recommended collection on the Stone label, with beguiling examples from Jean Fran\u00e7aix, Cheryl Frances-Hoad, Gordon Crosse and William Alwyn, each played with intense commitment by these two outstanding players, their love for this music evident in every bar.\n\u2022 A new release on the Hall\u00e9 label from Mark Elder and the Hall\u00e9 orchestra underlines one theory on the enigmas that run through Shostakovich\u2019s Fifth Symphony, a work written in 1937 after the composer was denounced in Pravda at the height of Stalin\u2019s \u201cGreat Terror\u201d. This \u201cSoviet artist\u2019s creative reply to just criticism\u201d, as it was subtitled, is pertinently coupled with the composer\u2019s Four Romances on Poems by Pushkin, sung by the bass James Platt. In weaving themes from the first of these romances into his symphony \u2013 a song that expresses faith in art surviving brutal suppression and desecration \u2013 Shostakovich was quite probably sending a defiant signal that he would not buckle in the face of threats from the state. Whatever the theories, the Hall\u00e9\u2019s playing in this live recording is magnificent, with Elder alert to all the nuances of this chilling, triumphant riddle of a score.\n\u2022 Still available on BBC Sounds, just, is a superb Hall\u00e9 concert from the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester, featuring a brilliant reading of Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019s \u201cEgyptian\u201d concerto by the pianist Stephen Hough. Find it. It\u2019s electrifying.\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nClassical music\n\n\n\n\nHome Listening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["home", "listen", "prais", "sonatina", "music", "guardian"]}
