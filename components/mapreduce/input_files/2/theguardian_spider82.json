Still, no one is complaining if she stimulates visions as wonderful as WH Auden\u2019s text, which Benjamin Britten (who was born on St Cecilia\u2019s Day) set as his Hymn to St Cecilia in 1942. \u201cBlessed Cecilia, appear in vision to all musicians/ appear and inspire\u201d, says the text, and Britten\u2019s vocal music refers to the violin, flute, trumpet and timpani \u2013 as did Purcell\u2019s setting of Dryden\u2019s A Song for St Cecilia\u2019s Day three centuries earlier.\nIt\u2019s the centrepiece of a fine new all-Britten disc from the RIAS Kammerchor under Justin Doyle (Harmonia Mundi): idiomatic readings in a quite resonant acoustic, more secure in its full-voiced choruses than in its solos. The challenging Gerard Manley Hopkins settings AMDG have not established themselves as strongly, but if Britten had composed nothing more than the perfect, touching Hymn to the Virgin he wrote when 16, he would be remembered.\n\u2022 St Cecilia was also at the heart of The Company of Heaven, an ingenious Wigmore Hall concert given last week by the Cardinall\u2019s Musick (Radio 3/BBC Sounds) devoted to music celebrating female saints. Among the resurrections, two settings of Cecilia\u2019s antiphon Cantantibus organis by Marenzio and the totally unknown Daniel Torquet were outshone by the sheer splendour and sonic glory of Cecilia Virgo by Peter Philips. Strongly profiled singing under Andrew Carwood.\n\u2022 It\u2019s good to see the great historical ensemble Concentus Musicus of Vienna reinventing itself after the death of its founder Nikolaus Harnoncourt, and marking out some different territory on disc under his successor, Stefan Gottfried (Aparte Music). Performing Webern\u2019s 20th-century orchestrations of Schubert songs on 19th-century instruments is pretty postmodern, but Florian Boesch\u2019s baritone is beautifully light and airy. And the attempt to finish Schubert\u2019s famously Unfinished Symphony (by completing his Scherzo sketch and adding a movement from his Rosamunde music) is vigorous and convincing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nWatch an album trailer for Concentus Musicus Wien\u2019s new Schubert disc.\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n\n\nClassical Music podcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["home", "listen", "ria", "kammerchor", "cardinal", "musick", "concentu", "musicu", "wien", "music", "guardian"]}
