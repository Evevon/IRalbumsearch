However, unlike Will.I.Am remixing Michael Jackson, or Giorgio Moroder allowing external producers to bastardise his trademark Europop on 2015\u2019s messy D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, the seven-track Hello Happiness pays respect to Khan\u2019s funk and disco heydays, drawing a through-line via modern production\u2019s showy window dressing.\nThe album arrives at an interesting juncture in Khan\u2019s career. In 2016, still reeling from the death of her friend Prince, Khan, along with her sister, checked into rehab to treat an addiction to painkillers, stating she \u201cknew it was time to take action to save our lives\u201d. That sense of clarity permeates the album\u2019s title track, where Khan joyously sings \u201cMusic makes me say goodbye sadness, hello happiness\u201d over an elastic bass line and chunky synths. She struts around the melody before finally letting go with a sky-rocketing cry of \u201cWanna dance, wanna dance\u201d that makes the song feel sweaty. That sensation continues into the throbbing, disco-tinged Like a Lady, while the irresistible funk of lead single Like Sugar cleverly creates pockets of space for Khan\u2019s rip-roaring vocal interjections to fade in and out, as if she\u2019s having so much fun dancing she forgot to step up to the mic.\nThe album sags, however, when the production starts to encroach on the star. Don\u2019t Cha Know is essentially an instrumental, with darting sonic textures, samples of crowd noise and a screeching central riff that drowns everything else out. The otherwise enjoyable Too Hot, in which Khan purrs her way through a lyric about feeding her hunger, is constantly interrupted by a juddering synth that sounds like it crept in from a different, less interesting song. Thankfully, Hello Happiness returns to what it does best.\nThe closing Ladylike is the album\u2019s quietest moment, with a simple guitar riff and distant percussion carrying a song that effortlessly reminds you of Khan\u2019s influence, on everyone from Whitney Houston to modern R&B practitioners such as Ella Mai. It ends, as it should, with Khan front and centre.\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nChaka Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop and rock\n\n\n\n\nDisco\n\n\n\n\nDance music\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["chaka", "khan", "hello", "happi", "review", "funk", "legend", "get", "vogueish", "updat", "music", "guardian"]}
