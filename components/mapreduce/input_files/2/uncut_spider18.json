Although no official announcement has been made, Hollis\u2019s cousin-in-law \u2013 the academic Anthony Costello \u2013 confirmed the news in a tweet yesterday (February 25) in which he called Hollis a \u201cWonderful husband and father. Fascinating and principled man.\u201dRIP Mark Hollis. Cousin-in-law. Wonderful husband and father. Fascinating and principled man. Retired from the music business 20 years ago but an indefinable musical icon. Talk Talk \u2013 It's My Life (Live at Montreux 1986) https://t.co/eGRfLWHt6r\u2014 Anthony Costello (@globalhlthtwit) February 25, 2019Order the latest issue of Uncut online and have it sent to your home!Hollis effectively retired from music following the release of his debut solo album in 1998 in order to spend more time with his children. He has maintained a distance from the music industry ever since, although he did contribute a piece to the soundtrack of the 2012 TV series Boss. As the frontman of Talk Talk, Hollis scored several global hits in the mid-80s with songs such as \u201cIt\u2019s My Life\u201d and \u201cLife\u2019s What You Make It\u201d. However, fame didn\u2019t sit well with Hollis, and he steered the band away from synth-pop and into a sparser, more contemplative realm influenced by Satie and Debussy on 1988\u2019s Sprit Of Eden and 1991\u2019s Laughing Stock. While regarded as \u2018difficult\u2019 at the time, these albums have proved hugely influential. \u201cI can\u2019t overstate the influence on us three as musicians and us as a band\u201d wrote Doves. \u201cHis music was rich and deep, and a huge influence on my development as a musician\u201d tweeted Blur\u2019s Dave Rowntree.Former Talk Talk bandmate Paul Webb AKA Rustin Mann wrote on Facebook that \u201cMusically he was a genius and it was a honour and a privilege to have been in a band with him. I have not seen Mark for many years, but like many musicians of our generation I have been profoundly influenced by his trailblazing musical ideas. He knew how to create a depth of feeling with sound and space like no other. He was one of the greats, if not the greatest.\u201dField Music said that Hollis\u2019s \u201c1998 solo album\u2026 has been an endless source of musical and conceptual inspiration to us\u201d. Chris Baio of Vampire Weekend wrote that, \u201cMark Hollis changed my life. Thank you for everything\u201d.Peers such as The The and Duran Duran also paid tribute to Hollis on social media.Goodbye Mark Hollis,We owe you so much ,I cant overstate the influence on us three as musicians and us as a band.#markhollis #talktalk\u2014 Doves (@dovesmusicblog) February 25, 2019Really sorry to hear of the death of Mark Hollis. His music was rich and deep, and a huge influence on my development as a musician.\u2014 David Rowntree (@DaveRowntree) February 25, 2019Very sad to hear that Mark Hollis has died. You might have experienced the wonder of those final three Talk Talk albums but his 1998 solo album is just as beautiful and has been an endless source of musical and conceptual inspiration to us.\u2014 Field Music (@fieldmusicmusic) February 25, 2019Mark Hollis changed my life. Thank you for everything\u2014 Chris Baio (@OIAB) February 25, 2019Very sorry to hear the news that #MarkHollis of #TalkTalk has died.
