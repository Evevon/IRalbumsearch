It is believed that he mailed the package to himself in May 1965 in an attempt to establish copyright.Lou Reed archivist Don Fleming opened the tape early last year to discover that it contained what is believed to be the first recorded version of \u201cI\u2019m Waiting For The Man\u201d, among other previously unheard tracks.\u201cIt was one of eleven songwriting demos that Lou seemed to have recorded on one day,\u201d explains the documentary\u2019s producer, Judith Kampfner. \u201cAs Don says it \u2018is perfectly formed\u2019 though to me Lou sounds very innocent. Don doesn\u2019t know who harmonises with Lou on the song. The harmony to me is a bit Simon & Garfunkel though Don says there is very much a Bob Dylan influence there. The other voice is most probably a guy who worked with Lou at Pickwick Records. It is very different from the VU version that was released. I get goosebumps every time I hear it.\u201cAccording to Don it was a bit of a struggle to get the tape to work at first. They heard the songs start but then shortly over that another track started. They brought in a music preservation expert who determined that it wasn\u2019t made on a commercial studio type of tape deck. It was made on some home deck that had weird tracking on the heads the way that it was set up. He had to reconfigure it.\u201cWhen I interviewed Don, he also played a few seconds of a couple of other songs but I don\u2019t talk about them in the show because we don\u2019t have any of the music. He says they most likely will release them at some time. I can say that he told me there were two songs that have never been released but that\u2019s all I can really say.\u201d The latest issue of Uncut includes an in-depth feature about the making of Lou Reed\u2019s 1989 album New York.
