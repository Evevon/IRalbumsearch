On a personal note, I feel like I am finishing something my father started years ago. And let\u2019s not forget, Frank himself will be rocking his fans, alongside his bandmates like nobody\u2019s business.\u201cWe will be pushing the limits of what anyone has seen holographically on stage before in a live venue. Circumstances, objects, places and subject matter from Frank\u2019s songs and imagination will be brought to life for the first time on stage. We are anthropomorphizing Frank\u2019s music, so his own hand drawn illustrations, classic imagery from his album artwork and characters from his songs can all interact and perform on stage.\u201dCheck our the tourdates below.
