Order the latest issue of Uncut online and have it sent to your home!Talking in more detail about the genesis of the album to Rolling Stone, Townshend reveals: \u201cI said I was not going to sign any contracts [to tour] unless we have new material. This has nothing to do with wanting a hit album. It has nothing to do with the fact that The Who need a new album. It\u2019s purely personal. It\u2019s about my pride, my sense of self-worth and self-dignity as a writer.\u201dTownshend goes on say that he\u2019s received an amazing response to his new songs from everyone\u2026 except Roger Daltrey. \u201cI had to bully him to respond and then it wasn\u2019t the response I wanted. He just blathered for a while and in the end I really stamped my foot and said, \u2018Roger, I don\u2019t care if you really like this stuff. You have to sing it. You\u2019ll like it in 10 years time.\u2019\u201dThe Who have announced that they will support the album with a tour of the USA, backed by a full orchestra. Dates are yet to be announced but venues are set to include Madison Square Garden and The Hollywood Bowl.Says Daltrey: \u201cBe aware Who fans! That just because it\u2019s The Who with an Orchestra, in no way will it compromise the way Pete and I deliver our music. This will be full throttle Who with horns and bells on.\u201dDetails of European shows will be announced soon.Subscribe to Uncut and make huge savings on the cover price \u2013 find out by clicking here!Like us on Facebook to keep up to date with the latest news from Uncut.The March 2019 issue of Uncut is now on sale in the UK \u2013 with New Order on the cover.
