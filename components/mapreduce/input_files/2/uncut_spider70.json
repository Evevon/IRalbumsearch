One of those albums is You Want It Darker: Cohen\u2019s swansong, released 19 days before his death on November 7, 2016, aged 82. Though gravely ill, he\u2019s working until the very end.Order the latest issue of Uncut online and have it sent to your home!PAT LEONARD [PRODUCER/CO-WRITER/PROGRAMMING]: He was getting really ill. The creative process was fairly normal up to a point, then it got to where he couldn\u2019t do every day, maybe just a couple of days, and even those days were truncated. It got tough. Some days I\u2019d come and all he could do was talk. That lyric, \u201cYou Want I Darker\u201d, I certainly know where that came from \u2013 yet sometimes we would laugh ourselves sick about just about anything. There was a very light heart there. He said a couple of times how lucky he felt. I have recordings of things we did that were as real and raw as anything I\u2019d ever heard. Live versions with Bill Bottrell playing guitar, me playing piano and bass, and Leonard singing. They were messy and noisy. By then, he wasn\u2019t really playing guitar. We did a couple of things where he would play his \u2018chop\u2019. You know how musicians talk about having \u2018chops\u2019? He had that fingerpicking pattern that he did, and he called it his \u2018chop\u2019. He only had one!ANJANI THOMAS: I remember Pat Leonard playing me this amazing track for \u201cTreaty\u201d. It was so beautiful, I cried when I heard it. Pat loved it, I loved it. I looked at Len and he said, \u201cYou know what, it\u2019s too beautiful.\u201d He said the music was too obviously moving, almost manipulative. Too emotional, too poignant. Too much! It was distracting him. He wanted to control it, he wanted some edge.LEONARD: Ironically, that early version is the one that\u2019s on the record. We used to talk about \u2018Treaty: The Movie\u2019, as I did no less than 25 versions of \u201cTreaty\u201d. There were some really interesting ones \u2013 the last one was so interesting, I think it pushed him back to the first one. In fact, his request for me to do a little string arrangement of it was an homage to how much effort went into the damn song. He said to me that ultimately it was about the line that he didn\u2019t have. There were many variations of the chorus, and until he found what he wanted it to say, we just kept trying it.SHARON ROBINSON [VOCALS]: He knew he was getting sick. It was a quiet time. We\u2019d get together to talk about life and death. Leonard lost a lot of friends during that period \u2013 he was almost in a continuous state of mourning, but he was intent on putting out another record and book, as he knew his time was limited. He wanted me to be involved, so he gave me the lyric \u201cOn The Level\u201d, and really liked what I wrote. I did the vocals in my own studio, but he played the whole record for me once it was finished, on his little boom box \u2013 which I think was the same boom box we worked with back in the \u201980s!LEONARD: At the end of the day, his son Adam finished it with him. There was some father/son stuff that I wasn\u2019t about to get in the middle of. You could see that he couldn\u2019t keep going much longer, it was just a matter of when something was going to happen. I don\u2019t like the \u2018tragic end\u2019 thing, because it wasn\u2019t. This was a beautiful man who died in his home with his children around him, and I guarantee the day he passed away he was working. He never stopped. No matter what, he worked. I know he was still looking for something else \u2013 looking for better.
