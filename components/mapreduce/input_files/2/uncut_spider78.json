Exiled in London, Marley and The Wailers make an album for all-comers: Side One is by turns angry, philosophical and mystical; Side Two offers uplifting party tunes.

They really went underground for a while, into exile.JUNIOR MARVIN: I met Bob in London on Valentine\u2019s Day 1977. We started rehearsing right away. My first jam that day was \u201cExodus\u201d, \u201cWaiting In Vain\u201d and \u201cJamming\u201d \u2013 we played each song for about 45 minutes. Bob was still putting final touches to the lyrics and the music with the keyboard player, Tyrone Downie, who at the time was filling in on bass. Tyrone and myself helped write \u201cExodus\u201d and \u201cIs This Love?\u201d It was a very electric experience. It was the first time I ever saw somebody\u2019s aura. He was so happy to be alive after the shooting, smiling and having a good time. He was very comfortable in London. There was a great Jamaican and Afro-Caribbean community, people from Ethiopia, Africa\u2026ASTON BARRETT: We spent some good times in London. Just living life, all of us in the band, doing music as we always did. Recording at Island studios was a vibe. It was nice.\n\nJUNIOR MARVIN: There was no rush in the studio, nobody watching the clock. We had it booked 24 hours a day; for Bob that was a dream come true. The songs on Exodus were generally more recent than the ones on Kaya. \u201cWaiting In Vain\u201d was fresh because he had just fallen in love with Cindy Breakspeare. \u201cExodus\u201d was partly written because Bob had left Jamaica after the shooting attempt \u2013 \u201cmovement of Jah people,\u201d meaning everyone is part of that movement, no matter your colour, creed or history. \u201cNatural Mystic\u201d was very current, because he couldn\u2019t believe he was still alive, getting protection from the spiritual vibration. The songs definitely had continuity and a special sense of time and place. It had love songs, too, but it had a militant edge. We had a good time recording live, the organic way. It would be drums, bass, piano, acoustic guitar, lead guitar, and rough vocals. Bob would redo his rhythm guitar, and a lot of the vocals. We spent a lot of time mixing, trying to perfect everything. We\u2019d compare our album with the top albums of the time and see how ours measured up sonically. It wasn\u2019t just great songs, but musically almost perfect. It really revolutionised the sound of reggae.You can read much more about Bob Marley & The Wailers in the latest issue of Uncut, on sale now with Leonard Cohen on the cover.Subscribe to Uncut and make huge savings on the cover price \u2013 find out by clicking here!Like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter to keep up to date with the latest news from Uncut.The March 2019 issue of Uncut is now on sale in the UK \u2013 with Leonard Cohen on the cover.
