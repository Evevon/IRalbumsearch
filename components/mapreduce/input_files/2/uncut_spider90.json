They include falling in love and becoming a mother, as well as productive forays into acting, academia and \u2013 most impressively \u2013 standup comedy.Order the latest issue of Uncut online and have it sent to your home!\u201cMy babysitter put on a variety show, and she asked me to perform,\u201d she explains. \u201cI had a solo show testing new material a week after, so I wasn\u2019t really interested in picking up an acoustic guitar\u2026 I texted her and asked, \u2018Can I try doing some standup?\u2019 And she was like, \u2018Are you kidding me?\u2019\u201d And so Sharon Van Etten made her nerve-racking standup debut, notes in hand. \u201cIt was anecdotal reports about being myself\u2026 a lot of rambling. It was really, really fun. It felt like the first day at school\u2026 not reinventing myself, but new.\u201dAs for the mindset behind the new album, Van Etten says: \u201cI\u2019m in a really good place, I\u2019m happy, I\u2019m secure, I\u2019m in love and I\u2019m doing all the things that I\u2019ve set out to do and more. And\u2026 I\u2019m still writing heavy songs! But they\u2019re not coming from a place of unhappiness. Maybe unease or insecurity \u2013 but not about my life, more about the world. Like, \u2018How I\u2019m gonna raise a child in a positive way with all the things that are going on?\u2019\u201d Opening with driving synths and big rock drums, current single \u201cComeback Kid\u201d sets the tone. It shows her voice in a new light, at once sultry, bullish and bruised. She describes it as \u201cmy New Jersey anthem\u2026 like if Pat Benatar and Bruce Springsteen wrote a song together\u2026 The story is about returning home and confronting people that you used to know. Like, \u2018I was a fuckup, but I\u2019ve got my shit together and I\u2019m in a different place now\u2026\u2019 Moving forward but acknowledging your demons.\u201dYou can read much more from Sharon Van Etten in the new issue of Uncut, in shops now with New Order on the cover.Subscribe to Uncut and make huge savings on the cover price \u2013 find out by clicking here!Like us on Facebook to keep up to date with the latest news from Uncut.The March 2019 issue of Uncut is now on sale in the UK \u2013 with New Order on the cover.
