A statement from the band claimed that the musician \u201cchose to point fingers and manufacture claims rather than doing what was necessary to continue to be a part of Slipknot.\u201dShortly after his exit, a fan tweeted Corey Taylor to suggest that the band\u2019s original singer and percussionist Anders Colsefni \u2013 who was a member from 1995-1997 \u2013 should step to fill the vacant spot. \u201cFuck I would LOVE that,\u201d Taylor replied in a now-deleted post.Now, as fans await further news on the band\u2019s line-up, Colsefni has issued a statement to confirm that he won\u2019t be reuniting with Slipknot. He states that there\u2019s no animosity between himself and the band, but that he\u2019s moved on and is focusing on supporting his family.\u201cI\u2019m going to take away the uncomfortable conversations that Slipknot might have regarding myself and reported band vacancy by saying:\nI will NOT be rejoining Slipknot,\u201d Colsefni\u2019s social media post began. \u201cIt is certainly not for any animosity I have \u2013 I simply don\u2019t know those guys anymore. I generally give those I don\u2019t know the benefit of the doubt.\u201cI\u2019ve spent the last 27 years (through each and every band) working concrete construction to support my family but still allow time for my \u201cReal Job\u201d lol.\u201dHe added: \u201cAfter many years of failed bands, failed marriages, and plenty of others, I\u2019ve settled into an occupation that I can retire from. I\u2019m gonna need the bennies \u2013 my body is going to shit! Lol!\u201cAs much as I had dreamed of rejoining my creation (shut up- I know it\u2019s a different band now!) it is not enough of a dream anymore to risk being homeless when the tour is over!\u201dColsefni concluded by saying that his band Painface is still active \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d, and told fans to \u201clook for us sometime this year\u201d.Meanwhile, Slipknot recently confirmed that their highly-anticipated new album will arrive on August 9. The group will return to the UK in June for a headline performance at Download Festival.Slipknot will then take their new material on the road in July, with shows continuing throughout August and September.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "pptitle": ["slipknot", "member", "confirm", "wont", "return", "band", "simpli", "dont", "know", "guy", "anymor"]}
