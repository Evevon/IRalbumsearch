The Australian filmmaker has co-written the screenplay with\u00a0Craig Pearce.Variety reports that Hanks is currently in talks with producers to start as Elvis\u2019 manager\u00a0Parker, who came across the singer in 1955 and subsequently signed him up as an exclusive client the following year. Parker, who was born in the Netherlands, was largely responsible for a number of milestone moments in Elvis\u2019 career, including the successful negotiation of his landmark record contract with RCA.Luhrmann is reportedly seeking an unknown actor for the main role of Elvis, with the director apparently meeting potential candidates at present.It\u2019s also thought that, should Hanks agree to play Parker, Warner Bros. will likely allocate a significant budget for Luhrmann\u2019s picture \u2013 with the director reportedly seeking to start production on the biopic later this year.Hanks is currently finishing filming\u00a0A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, in which he\u2019ll play the beloved US TV host Mr. Rogers. Later this summer, he\u2019ll make what will likely be his final Toy Story bow when the fourth film in the franchise is released.", "pptitle": ["tom", "hank", "set", "play", "colonel", "tom", "parker", "elvi", "biopic"]}
