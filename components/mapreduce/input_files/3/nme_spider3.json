Lyrically, the song that seems to takes aim at the drug industry; frontman Isaac Brock sings \u201cMedicine makers they are trying to kill us / They know how to cure us, but they bet that\u2019s bad for business now.\u201dYou can listen to the song here:Last year, Jonny Marr revealed that he would most like to reunite with The The and Modest Mouse\u00a0out of all his former bands.\u201cLast year I did a couple of things while I was making \u2018Call The Comet\u2019,\u201d the guitarist and solo star told NME. \u201cI did a The The comeback single, which was their first for 15 or 16 years. That was a real joy, to be playing behind Matt Johnson again.\u201cI never really think the door is shut on The The, and I\u2019ve got a feeling that Modest Mouse is a chapter that\u2019s yet to be finished. Those are the two people I\u2019d like to work with again.\u201dIn September, Modest Mouse will embark on a tour of North America together with The Black Keys.", "pptitle": ["listen", "poison", "song", "modest", "mous", "year"]}
