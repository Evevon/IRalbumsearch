The 1975 frontman aired his views on the practice on Twitter, starting a debate amongst his followers. \u201cWho came up with payed meet and greets?\u201d He wrote yesterday (March 26). \u201cDid they think \u2018Surely there must be something else we can monetise\u2026\u2026OH! Human connection!! They\u2019ll eat that up!\u2019\u201dHe continued, writing in all capitals: \u201cMeet your fans or don\u2019t. Don\u2019t only meet them if you\u2019re getting payed honestly what are you doing.\u201d Healy picked up the thread again today, responding to someone who suggested paid meet and greets were \u201cgood for lower and up and coming artists\u201d. \u201cYou can\u2019t be big enough for people to want to pay to meet you whilst not being big enough to pay for touring,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a paradoxical excuse for making MUSIC EXCLUSIVE. \u2018Rich kids, you line up on the left. Poor kids, just fuck off\u2019.\u201dWhen another fan sided with him, saying the topic \u201cshouldn\u2019t be debatable\u201d, Healy added: \u201cI think the problem is that a lot of artists don\u2019t understand how brutal it is, because MAJOR LABELS have normalised it. So MAJOR LABELS should change it.\u201dThe frontman offered an idea of how to change companies\u2019 views of meet and greets, writing: \u201cThey should make all fans pay in cash \u2013 directly to the artist. They should literally hand over the $200. Would soon stop.\u201d Meanwhile, in February, The 1975 renewed their record deal with Dirty Hit. The label has been the band\u2019s home since 2012, when they released the debut EP \u2018Facedown\u2019 together. Label boss Jamie Oborne confirmed the new deal would see the band release at least another three albums with Dirty Hit. ", "pptitle": ["matti", "heali", "speak", "charg", "fan", "meet", "greet"]}
