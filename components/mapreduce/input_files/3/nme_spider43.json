But their festival season next year could feature an event planned by themselves. Healy tweeted earlier today (March 27): \u201cIf The 1975 & Co. put on their own festival next year, over 3 nights in the UK, who\u2019s coming?\u201dHe followed up that tweet with another that assured fans he was \u201c#notlying\u201d.It\u2019s unclear exactly who \u201cThe 1975 & Co.\u201d could encapsulate, but it seems likely the frontman is referring to the group of artists they share a label home with on Dirty Hit. That means the likes of Wolf Alice, Pale Waves, The Japanese House, No Rome, Beabadoobee, Just Banco, and more could appear at the proposed festival. Meanwhile, Healy has also been vocal about the practice of labels and bands charging fans for meet and greets. The star sparked debate amongst his followers when he suggested it was a way of monetising human connection and described it as a \u201cparadoxical excuse for making music exclusive.\u201d The 1975 released their latest album \u2018A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships\u2019 in November 2018. They are set to release the follow-up, \u2018Notes On A Conditional Form\u2019, later this year. In February, the band won two trophies at the 2019 BRIT Awards \u2013 Best British Group and Best British Album. Healy\u2019s mother Denise Welch reacted to the news by jokingly taking the credit for their success. \u201cSpeechless!,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cJust crying thinking of them playing with their cheap drums and guitars in the garage!!! And obs it\u2019s all down to me!!\u201d", "pptitle": ["matti", "heali", "suggest", "1975", "festiv", "year"]}
