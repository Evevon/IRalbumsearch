It is unclear whether it\u2019s a trailer for a new video or a forthcoming album.Earlier today (March 26), the band\u2019s Spotify account also started featuring a series of vertical video clips with their top songs, teasing something for this Friday (March 29).The clips contain the running themes of a black woman dressed in various stylised outfits, and frontman Till Lindemann\u2019s severed head.The band recently\u00a0completed their new album with Muse producer Rich Costey, and previously revealed plans to release five new music videos.Their as-yet-untitled album will be the band\u2019s seventh studio effort, which is slated for an April release ahead of their European stadium tour. The long-awaited record will be the\u00a0follow-up to 2009\u2019s \u2018Liebe Ist F\u00fcr Alle Da\u2018.\u201cWe flew to Los Angeles to mix the record with Rich Costey, who has worked with Muse and a bunch of other big bands,\u201d\u00a0guitarist Richard Z. Kruspe explained.\u201cIt looks like we will have five music videos coming out this time, too. I feel really happy with the album, although a few things might still change, of\u00a0course.\u201dRammstein are on tour throughout 2019. The German icons will play their only\u00a0UK gig\u00a0at Stadium\u00a0MK\u00a0in Milton Keynes on July\u00a06.\u00a0For their full tour dates, click here.", "pptitle": ["rammstein", "teas", "seri", "cryptic", "video", "clip"]}
