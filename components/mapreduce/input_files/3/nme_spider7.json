They\u2019ve sold the best part of who gives a shit how many million records and been an essential touchstone in the genres of post-punk, New Wave, goth, alternative, shoegaze and post-rock.\u201cThey\u2019ve been in and out of fashion so many times in the last four decades that they ended up transcending fashion itself. Though they might be a hip name to drop in 2019, this wasn\u2019t always the case. Their dedication to pushing sonic and artistic boundaries while making music for the ages wasn\u2019t always rewarded with glowing reviews in the press.\u201dHe continued: \u201cBut they never failed to attract a passionate, intelligent and loyal fanbase who always knew the truth: The Cure are one of the most unique, most brilliant, most heartbreakingly excellent rock bands the world has ever known.\u201dIn his acceptance speech, Smith thanked all those who had been a part of The Cure\u2019s story, \u201cfor better or worse\u201d and paid tribute to the \u201cmuch missed\u201d former drummer Andy Anderson, who died recently after a battle with cancer.You can see footage and images from their performance here:Recently,\u00a0Smith confirmed that The Cure have finished recording their new album.\u00a0The record, which is as-yet-untitled and has no release date, will be the band\u2019s first studio release in over 10 years and their 14th studio album.Speaking on The John Maytham Show on Cape Town radio station Cape Talk, Smith said of their recent shows: \u201cWe\u2019ve enjoyed it and we\u2019ve just recorded a new album for the first time in 10 years.\u201d He added that he was \u201cstill doing this for the right reasons\u201d and that, while the group might cover different styles of music, but \u201cbecause it\u2019s us doing it, it sounds us.\u201dThe Cure were also\u00a0confirmed to be headlining this year\u2019s Glastonbury Festival earlier this month (March 15). They join Stormzy and The Killers at the top of a bill that also includes the likes of Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Liam Gallagher, Tame Impala, Vampire Weekend, Bastille, Billie Eilish, and more.", "pptitle": ["watch", "cure", "perform", "induct", "rock", "roll", "hall", "fame"]}
