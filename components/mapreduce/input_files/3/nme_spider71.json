The new music sounds really cool and the ideas are flowing.\u201d\nAsked about where the band may be heading sonically following \u2018Last Young Renegade\u2019, Gaskarth said that he and his bandmates had learned \u201cin terms of the sound and some of the moods\u201d from the process of recording their 2017 album.\u201cSome of my favourite songs that we\u2019ve ever written are on that record, but maybe what it didn\u2019t provide was a lot of the fast pace and tempo that a lot of people are used to,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen I look back and think about it critically, there wasn\u2019t a lot of \u2018party music\u2019, that our band has normally been known for. That record was a little more tame and mellow, so we want to take what we learned from \u2018Last Young Renegade\u2019 and maybe make it a bit more upbeat. We want our next record to be more energetic and indicative of the moshpits that we came from.\u201dSimple Creatures will release their debut EP \u2018Strange Love\u2019 on Friday (March 29). They\u2019ll play a one-off show in London on April 3.", "pptitle": ["alex", "gaskarth", "time", "low", "energet", "album", "idea", "flow"]}
