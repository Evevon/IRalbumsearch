NME\u2019s Olly Richards, who attended the preview, wrote: \u201cIn one scene, looking rather worse for wear, John says, \u2018I\u2019m an alcoholic, sex addict and probably a shopaholic.\u2019 Egerton adds that the film begins with John entering rehab, then the film unfolds as he tells of how he ended up so broken.\u201dIt looks to be a far cry from\u00a0Fletcher\u2019s previous film, Bohemian Rhapsody, which was criticised for skimming over Queen frontman Freddie Mercury\u2019s addictions and sexuality.Elsewhere in the Q&A at the screening, Fletcher revealed that Rocketman is more of a musical than a typical bipoic.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t describe it as a biopic\u2026it\u2019s a musical,\u201d Fletcher said. The first minutes of footage aired at the preview show Egerton with a huge troupe of extras dancing through a fairground singing \u2018Saturday\u2019. Characters in the film break into song and John\u2019s material will be woven into the narrative.Fletcher has also denied rumours that a gay sex scene has been removed from Rocketman.Taking to Twitter, Fletcher responded to the reports by writing: \u201cSeeing much speculation about ROCKETMAN! That\u2019s good! It\u2019s still unfinished so it\u2019s nothing but rumours. It has and always will be the no holds barred, musical fantasy that Paramount and producers passionately support and believe in.\u201dRocketman is released in cinemas on May 24.", "pptitle": ["im", "alcohol", "sex", "addict", "probabl", "shopahol", "rocketman", "wont", "whitewash", "elton", "john", "life"]}
