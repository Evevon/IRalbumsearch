In other words, MJ changed music, like, forever.\u201dNow, official confirmation comes via a statement issued to Pitchfork.\u201cMichael Jackson was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Jackson 5 in 1997 and as a solo artist in 2001,\u201d they confirmed in a statement.\u201cAs with all of our inductees, Jackson was recognized for musical excellence and talent as well as having a significant impact on rock\u2019n\u2019roll, and was elected by a diverse voting body of historians, fellow musicians, and music industry professionals. Original artifacts and memorabilia from many artists\u2019 lives and performances are on display in our exhibits. There are no plans for this to change.\u201dThis comes after Madame Tussauds have said that all waxwork statues of Michael Jackson are set to remain on display at all of their museums while the Thriller musical will also continue.\u2018The figures on display at Madame Tussauds reflect profiles that have had an impact on popular culture and that visitors expect to see,\u201d a spokesperson told NME.\u201cMichael Jackson has been and is currently a feature of Madame Tussauds attractions around the world. We regularly monitor our choice of figures on display based on external events and visitor feedback.\u201dRudi Dolezal, a music video producer who worked with Jackson for numerous years, also recently described the singer as \u201ca predator\u201d and spoke out for the accusers.\u201cI believe almost every word. It\u2019s brilliant work,\u201d he said of Leaving Neverland.\u00a0\u201cNobody would stop Michael,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe an icon is a con.\u201dBut Jackson\u2019s niece Brandi has also claimed that the accusers were \u201cliars\u201d\u00a0and \u201cmotivated by money\u201d, while\u00a0Aaron Carter also questioned their motives and said that they were \u201cstomping on a legend\u2019s grave\u201c.Earlier this month, Jackson\u2019s nephew\u00a0Taj confirmed to\u00a0NME\u00a0that he was working on a \u00a0counter-documentary to hit back at the claims made by Robson and Safechuck in the film.", "pptitle": ["rock", "roll", "hall", "fame", "confirm", "michael", "jackson", "remain", "induct", "despit", "leav", "neverland", "controversi"]}
