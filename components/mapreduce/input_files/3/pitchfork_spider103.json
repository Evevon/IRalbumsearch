Cycling through shape-shifting riffs as if trying to outfox the cops, the duo sings in perfect disharmony about playing in a rock band, touring the nation, making duty-free pit stops, and, yes, using that white stuff. The song so effortlessly resituates Herrema and Hagerty in their element, it seems auto-generated by an algorithm that\u2019s learned all Royal Trux\u2019s old tricks. But as Herrema and Hagerty\u2019s turbulent track record has shown, nothing here is ever the way it truly appears.\nLate BBC DJ John Peel quipped that his favorite band, the Fall, were \u201calways different, always the same.\u201d Throughout the 1990s, Royal Trux sounded like they were always together but always unraveling, too. Creative and romantic partners at the time, Herrema and Hagerty belonged to no particular city or scene beyond their own self-contained upside-down universe, where sleazy rock was rendered avant-garde and vice versa. Shortly after releasing their most congenial, conventional album, 2000\u2019s Pound for Pound, the partnership collapsed, spurred in part by tough-love interventions for a relapsing Herrema.\nGiven the messy nature of their breakup, Royal Trux\u2019s reunion for White Stuff has been surprising and, in the end, predictably dysfunctional. A winter North American tour was reportedly canceled on account of Herrema\u2019s priors (but rescheduled for the spring, it seems), while a recent MOJO interview and a series of cryptic Tweets from Hagerty suggest a lingering discord. But if the tenuous truce should only last long enough to yield White Stuff, the brief reconciliation was not in vain.\nRoyal Trux\u2019s \u201990s catalog embraced the outsized mythology and sinister allure of classic rock when their indie peers sought to dismantle it; they reemerge on White Stuff at a moment when guitar-based rock has been pushed to the margins in the mainstream and underground alike. Rather than lament this state of affairs, Royal Trux again revel in it. Throughout White Stuff, Herrema and Hagerty treat the hallowed building blocks of classic rock\u2014chunky riffs, rippin\u2019 guitar solos, cowbell-clankin\u2019 grooves\u2014like discarded parts salvaged from the landfill. They upcycle them into the 1979 fairground fantasia of their dreams, a place where you might score the Royal Trux-branded coke mirror on the cover by winning a carnival game. Atop the arpeggio-slathered chug of \u201cYear of the Dog,\u201d they ask, \u201cCan you hear rock\u2019n\u2019roll, in the year of the dog?\u201d Assuming the answer is no, the duo deviously triggers their trusty phasing effects and sends the song careening like a Tilt-a-Whirl with busted controls.\nForsaking the earthier vibe of later Trux records like Veterans of Disorder and Pound for Pound, White Stuff feels like an extension of Herrema\u2019s work with Black Bananas, thriving on the tension between old-school authenticity and modernist manipulations. Tracks like \u201cPurple Audacity #2\u201d and \u201cUnder Ice\u201d start out as deceptively anthemic sing-alongs, though the swaggering grooves, lysergic riffs, and synth smears eventually meld into hallucinatory swirls. \u201cSic Em Slow\u201d is a tough boogie birthed from a flurry of tropical electronics. Kool Keith, meanwhile, turns up to rap about pizza on the boombox electro jam \u201cGet Used to This,\u201d the great Judgment Night deep cut that never was.\nHerrema and Hagerty wrote these songs via emailed file swaps, and Hagerty reportedly bailed on recording sessions before the album was completed. Still, the duo\u2019s piss-and-vinegar vocal dynamic feels as broken-in as an old baseball mitt. In the past, Herrema and Hagerty often took solo lead turns; here, there\u2019s rarely a moment when their voices aren\u2019t overlapping. The ravaged tandem can be surprisingly poignant, too. \u201cSuburban Junkie Lady\u201d is a slow-motion psych-funk reverie about empathizing with a homeless woman trucking her life\u2019s belongings in a shopping cart, as passersby blithely toss her food from their cars. Herrema\u2019s a fashion stylist and designer in L.A. now, Hagerty a Denver-based dad\u2014this song, though, serves as a blood-pact reminder of their hardscrabble past.\nBut Royal Trux never sound more pure and fully realized than when practicing the fine art of falling apart. On White Stuff\u2019s most disorienting track, \u201cPurple Audacity #1,\u201d Herrema and Hagerty sing competing melodies as if waging a custody battle over the track\u2019s prog-reggae rhythm. An atonal guitar solo blares continuously, like a broken television in the next room. Hagerty somehow twists a nonsensical mantra\u2014\u201cSouthern California drivers are the 19th wonder of the world!\u201d\u2014into a catchy hook. For all the admirers and imitators Royal Trux have amassed in absentia, no one else can make music like this. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be.\n", "pptitle": ["white", "stuff"]}
