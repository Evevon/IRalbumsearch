Not long into her fourth solo album, On the Line, Jenny Lewis introduces a narcoleptic poet from Duluth, with whom she spars over everything from Elliott Smith to grenadine; a father who used to sing a little ditty about all the years he threw away on heroin; an East Side girl called Caroline, to whom a lover is bitterly lost. There\u2019s mention of Candy Crush, Slip\u2019N Slides, Rambo, Marlboros, Meryl Streep\u2019s tears, Dorothy\u2019s ruby slippers, Don Quixote, the rivalry between the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, the bridge in La Crosse, Wisconsin, a couple different kinds of fancy cars, one disgusting-sounding drink, and a truly staggering amount of illegal drugs.\nBursting with all this specificity, which fuels vivid scenes and impressionistic turns of phrase alike, On the Line ushers in something that has long been gestating in its creator, bit by bit with every \u201cDoes He Love You,\u201d \u201cRabbit Fur Coat,\u201d and \u201cAloha & the Three Johns\u201d: Jenny Lewis has reached her troubadour phase. She\u2019s telling tales like never before, singing live in the studio while charismatically leading a band that includes elder statesmen like Benmont Tench and Don Was, not to mention cameos from Ringo Starr, Beck, and Ryan Adams (recorded before the allegations against him emerged). Acid Tongue, from 2008, and 2014\u2019s The Voyager shed more of that twee sensibility from Lewis\u2019 Rilo Kiley days, edging her a little closer to a skeptical Stevie Nicks for old millennials. That journey continues with On the Line.\nSomething consistently wonderful about Jenny Lewis\u2019 music, going back to Rilo Kiley, is how quickly she allows her protagonists to get carried away into daydreams, tangents of emotion, and imagined declarations. Sometimes this manifests musically, like when a song goes from lo-fi black and white to technicolor and cinematic in a flash. On the sprawling ballad \u201cDogwood,\u201d she starts off so quiet you can hear ambient studio noises. She entertains a moody, Johnny Marr-ish guitar interlude, then floats into a stop the song, I just gotta sang moment, complete with warm layers of her own vocals and the percussion emitting a kind of subtle \u201cboom.\u201d Then poof, the memory falls away, and she\u2019s back to just her piano and her far-away voice and her simple observation that the dogwood trees are in bloom again. How natural it sounds, Lewis playing the piano that Carole King recorded Tapestry on, quietly resigned to the fact that two human bodies in motion will stay in motion, bullshit be damned.\nOn the flip side of On the Line, there are a couple of songs that trade stark lucidity for abstraction, and their frivolity stands out precisely because of their position next to some of the strongest songwriting of Lewis\u2019 career. The track preceding \u201cDogwood,\u201d \u201cDo Si Do,\u201d splits the difference between Tame Impala and modern-day Beck (he produced it, along with two others here) and finds a catchy sweet spot musically, but the lyrics lapse into non sequiturs that don\u2019t entirely land (\u201cThis ain\u2019t no ghetto, Jo/You\u2019re on the payroll!\u201d). And closing track \u201cRabbit Hole\u201d feels slightly clich\u00e9d, from the central metaphor of going down Alice\u2019s rabbit hole with an ex to the familiar but unplaceable melody to the pop-rock production style that seems a half-decade or so too late.\nThere has always been a certain amount of skepticism surrounding Lewis\u2019 more overt attempts at hit-making (see: 2007\u2019s Under the Blacklight), and part of that stems from her uncanny ability to do both: write classic pop songs that will forever lodge themselves into your brain and pepper them with lyrics (and aesthetic markers like an emo sensibility or a chintzy drum machine) that are unshakeable in their specificity and proximity to your own concerns. Half just doesn\u2019t seem enough, especially since Lewis gives it all in the album\u2019s best moments. \u201cWasted Youth,\u201d among the handful of songs that reckon with family demons in light of Lewis\u2019 estranged drug-addict mother\u2019s battle with cancer, is a plucky piano-pop tune haunted by rock\u2019s weary soul. This manifests in a catchy, slightly eerie chorus about addiction: \u201cI wasted my youth on a poppy, doo doo doo doo doo doo just for fun,\u201d sings Lewis, stretching into her falsetto with a disarming delicateness.\nWhen it\u2019s time for the album\u2019s toughest scene, though, Lewis stays cool and more importantly, funky. On \u201cLittle White Dove,\u201d relaxed-fit bass grooves and stuttering drums propel a surreal hospital visit, wherein the daughter must be the bigger person and forgive the ailing mother. \u201cI\u2019m the heroin,\u201d she sings, a little detached, leaning into the homonym. It is from this kind of seemingly simple line that Jenny Lewis often wrings the most emotional truth. That, too, is another sign of good storytelling.\n", "pptitle": ["line"]}
