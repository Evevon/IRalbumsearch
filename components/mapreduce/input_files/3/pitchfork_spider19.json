We Wanna Be Hyp-No-Tized is the Pavement co-founder\u2019s third album as Spiral Stairs, or his fifth solo LP overall, counting two sometimes tedious ventures as Preston School of Industry. Though it represents his strongest and most immediately appealing output to date, Hyp-No-Tized eventually succumbs to the central conundrum of Kannberg\u2019s post-Pavement output: On his own, he\u2019s not a particularly compelling songwriter. The album aspires to cult-classic obscurity and lands in the realm of the tolerably generic.\nTwangy, sun-bronzed rock is familiar Spiral Stairs territory, explored first on 2009\u2019s The Real Feel and again eight years later on 2017\u2019s Doris and the Daggers. Hyp-No-Tized accelerates the style to a faster clip, generously supplementing its guitar parts with saxophone and trumpet. The occasional forays into psychedelia\u2014on jaunty opener \u201cHyp-No-Tized,\u201d probably the strongest track of the bunch, and \u201cBTG,\u201d short for \u201cBlame the Government\u201d\u2014feel effective, if not quite revelatory. Kannberg is a more assured and less nasal singer than he once was, an achievement he credits to imitating Van Morrison. But his lyrical abilities continue to lag behind his instrumental talents: At nearly every turn, he\u2019s hampered by clunky phrasing, whether regrettable rhymes of convenience (\u201cYou were dressed up as a clown[...]/You just couldn\u2019t hide your frown\u201d) or ideas more eloquently expressed elsewhere (\u201cThere\u2019s something bad going down in Denmark\u201d).\nWhere Doris and the Daggers incorporated more personal reflection, Hyp-No-Tized taps into a timely but vague political theme. The nonspecific approach offers advantages: The United States\u2019 long political nightmare needs no introduction, nor does anyone want to find out what rhymes with \u201cTrump.\u201d The cumulative effect, though, is uninspired. \u201cSwampland\u201d rebukes Washington, D.C. by embracing its most hackneyed metaphor. \u201cFingerprintz\u201d begins by decrying partisan bickering, but halfway through it meanders into a thicket of instrumentation, never to return to the subject.\nThe album\u2019s most topical entry, \u201cBorderline,\u201d addresses sensationalized talk of border walls and migrant caravans\u2014issues on which Kannberg, as a Californian now living in Mexico, could offer a perspective. Yet the song operates in trite and indelicate couplets (\u201cThey\u2019ll take your bread/And shoot you dead\u201d), dimming the appeal of what would otherwise be solid pseudo-classic rock. As always, it\u2019s near impossible to avoid comparison to former bandmate Stephen Malkmus, whose latter-day career has yielded both more incisive commentary (\u201cSenator,\u201d \u201cMiddle America\u201d) and more enjoyable nonsense.\nThose determined to listen to the entirety of the greater Pavement-related discography will surely find things to appreciate: the confident strut of the title track, the guitars that lap and corner around Kannberg\u2019s vocals on \u201cHold On (Til I Figure It Out).\u201d These are exciting moments and help elevate We Wanna Be Hyp-No-Tized above its predecessors, which is not a high bar to clear.\n", "pptitle": ["wanna", "hypnot"]}
