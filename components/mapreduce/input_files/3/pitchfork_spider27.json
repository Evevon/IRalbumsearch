Right after graduating high school, the California native started working summers at Alaska\u2019s Katmai National Park so he could afford to attend Musicians Institute\u2019s certificate program in Los Angeles, eventually becoming a fly-fishing, bear-tracking outdoorsman. But back in L.A., Zacari\u2019s music career was popping off, and by 2016, he was already contributing vocals on tracks for TDE heavies like Isaiah Rashad, Kendrick Lamar, and Ab-Soul. The following year, when Zacari ended up on Kendrick\u2019s heartfelt DAMN. track, \u201cLOVE.,\u201d his tender falsetto brightening up the otherwise grim album, people were clamoring to find out more about the relatively unknown artist.\nNow two years after his DAMN. breakout, Zacari has finally unveiled his debut Run Wild Run Free EP, a project he says is indebted to his time spent in nature. \u201cA lot of the sounds and tones are drawn from my experiences in Alaska,\u201d he explained. \u201cI want the project to feel like a breath of fresh air.\u201d It\u2019s a concept that\u2019s already been broached in the pop sphere by Pharrell prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Maggie Rogers, whose viral hit \u201cAlaska\u201d is buoyed by lilting drums and carefully placed samples collected during her own cathartic visit to the state. Throughout Run Wild Run Free, Zacari tries to establish the same feeling of clarity and weightlessness. But ultimately, Zacari\u2019s EP is too burdened with clumsy songwriting and bad advice.\nZacari\u2019s songs are riddled with the kind of empty platitudes that would be posted up on a \u201cinspirational\u201d Pinterest board. On \u201cLone Wolf,\u201d Zacari repeats the provocative line, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know myself, I\u2019d be alone,\u201d over and over again, but fails to explore the idea in depth and instead boasts about owning Gucci loafers. On the title track, his voice wavers like he\u2019s trying to emulate the vulnerability of \u201cRich & Sad\u201d king Post Malone: \u201cYeah, I'm an animal, yeah, I'm radical/Yeah, sign of the horns up, I'm radical.\u201d Zacari just ends up sounding like a floundering rapper who can\u2019t think of a different word to rhyme with in a freestyle.\n\u201cYoung and Invincible,\u201d featuring Lil Yachty, is equally cringe-worthy. Zacari offers a Nickelodeon-dad vision of rebellious young people: \u201cRiding around the town, bumping our music loud/Emptying bank accounts.\u201d As if the song couldn\u2019t get more anti-establishmentarian-lite, a voice that sounds like it\u2019s yelling over the intercom announces, \u201cWill Lil Yachty please come to the principal\u2019s office.\u201d This gag might have worked when Yachty was still the king of teens (he turned 21 in August), and if he sounded like he had an ounce of commitment to his goofball class clown character. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to the rules,\u201d he sings in a dour, Eeyore-ish voice. And then when he finally gets to the mic-drop moment, he sheepishly offers \u201cFuck Trump, get rich,\u201d his words trailing off like he couldn\u2019t wait two more seconds to run out of the recording booth.\nZacari\u2019s songwriting has occasional bright moments. He\u2019s most successful when he intentionally employs repetition. On \u201cDon\u2019t Trip,\u201d the hook quite simply goes: \u201cWhatchu trippin\u2019 on, trippin\u2019 on, trippin\u2019 on me for?\u201d But the chugging hook mimics the rhythm of cyclical arguments he describes, while the hazy groove soothes the friction generated by his lyrics. It\u2019s a respite.\nThe closest that Zacari gets to recreating the magic of Kendrick\u2019s \u201cLOVE.\u201d is on \u201cTen Out of Ten.\u201d His agile, sentimental falsetto is heartfelt, the tender background vocals pooling up against rugged drums and intermittent found samples. But Zacari kills the romance with clunky lines like, \u201cTop of the morning/She gives me top in the morning,\u201d immediately followed by a incongruously gorgeous vocal run. It\u2019s a common failing of \u201csad\u201d pop stars like Khalid and Billie Eilish, prioritizing a captivating mood ahead of the lyrics. On \u201cLOVE.,\u201d Zacari proved that he could establish a vibe. With his debut EP, he\u2019s yet to show that he\u2019s capable of much more.\n", "pptitle": ["run", "wild", "run", "free"]}
