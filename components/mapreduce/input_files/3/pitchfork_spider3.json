After smothering his voice with all kinds of effects for long stretches, he\u2019ll cut the switch and present his voice naked, and every time it\u2019s as satisfying as the first swipe of a wiper blade across a rainy windshield. Lambchop\u2019s Kurt Wagner pulls that move just once on his latest album This (is what I wanted to tell you), but he makes it count, waiting until the final track \u201cFlowers\u201d for the big reveal: His natural, 60-year-old voice, treated so completely throughout the album you begin to forget that he hasn\u2019t always defaulted to a digitalized croon.\nWagner traded alt-country for electronic soul on 2016\u2019s FLOTUS\u2014a radical swap executed so gracefully and lovingly that he somehow made it feel like a natural progression. Still, anybody who missed that record is in for a surprise. Wagner has gone all-in on his vocoded mutter, and he\u2019s reconfigured his songwriting to accommodate it, trimming away the chamber-pop adornments and merry excesses that once distinguished Lambchop\u2019s records to center each song around his gentle prose.\nFor an artist who came to electronic music so late in life, it\u2019s remarkable how astute his impulses are\u2014and even more impressive still considering Wagner\u2019s background in alt-country, a genre that is rarely prone to innovation. Rather than playing up his reinvented sound on This (is what I wanted to tell you), Wagner opts for tasteful restraint. Every track is cushioned with pillowy pianos and massaging basslines. Even the album\u2019s boldest ideas are understated. With its light, acid jazz groove, \u201cEverything is You\u201d calls back to Us3\u2019s early \u201990s staple \u201cCantaloop (Flip Fantasia)\u201d\u2014you\u2019ll remember it when you hear it\u2014but never pats itself on the back for its own cleverness.\nThe occasional echoes of Bon Iver, the most prominent indie act to use vocal manipulation as an instrument unto itself, aren\u2019t entirely accidental, since Bon Iver\u2019s Matthew McCaughan produced the album and co-wrote parts of it. But unlike Justin Vernon, who used digital effects to push his voice to the edge of decay on 22, A Million, Wagner processes his voice not to obscure it but to draw warmth from it. Like the music itself, his vocal treatments are fragile and unpretentious. Nothing is obscured, nothing asks to be decoded. Everything about this sound is done in the service of intimacy.\nAnd so it is with his lyrics, which suggest wisdom even as they meditate on uncertainty. On \u201cThe Air is Heavy and I Should Be Listening to You,\u201d he relives a couple\u2019s argument that breaks out during a bout of Sunday house cleaning. \u201cThe air is filled with lemon-scented displeasure,\u201d he recalls. He writes in fragments of the mundane, juxtaposing direct thoughts with half-completed ones, then padding them with imagery ported from television and cable news (among them \u201cthe man with the Nixon tattoo,\u201d presumably Roger Stone, one of those random, unshakable visuals that will serve as a marker for this precise moment in time). On \u201cCrosswords, or What This Says About You,\u201d he loses his partner at the airport, so he enjoys a moment at the bar. \u201cSeems like they used to be much larger than they are right now,\u201d he observes, never specifying what \u201cthey\u201d might be.\nIt\u2019s such a modest album, and yet such it\u2019s a supremely pleasurable one. Wagner sounds humbled by the world, if not the very technology he\u2019s adopted. Before \u201cFlowers\u201d ends the record with a plea for love\u2014\u201cIf I gave you a hundred dollars to record just three words, I could make the perfect song,\u201d he sings\u2014he\u2019s made a disarming case for understanding that it\u2019s hard to imagine him pulling off in a setting less masterfully intimate. Wagner\u2019s quarter-century track record with Lambchop only underscores what a gem This is. He\u2019s made great records before, even exciting and unexpected ones, but never one so comforting and compassionate.\n", "pptitle": ["want", "tell"]}
