Instead, they lurch somewhere in between the down-tuned pummel of bands like Buzzov\u2022en and Eyehategod and the ultraviolent spazzes of Burmese or Brainbombs. A trio of Austin experimental rock veterans, they are led by Shit and Shine\u2019s Craig Clouse on guitar and vocals and rounded out with Butthole Surfers drummer King Coffey and When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth\u2019s Nate Cross on bass. Their debut Laredo was a bent-out sunstroke of processed vocals and noise-laden riffs, and its followup Matamoros is slower, freakier, and somehow louder.\n\u201cMatamoros\u201d rolls out slathered in feedback and erupts into what sounds like rubble coming to life. Clouse has an ear for crushing doom riffs, yet he prefers to take them on long marches to nowhere. \u201cMatamoros\u201d keeps rumbling on, gaining more feedback until it breaks apart. Closer \u201cAnxious Whitey\u201d takes this approach and stretches it over 17 minutes. It might madden some, but there\u2019s a perverse satisfaction to hearing Clouse tease a sick riff only to let it bleed back out into nothingness.\nShit and Shine and Butthole Surfers dressed up experimental music in humor and absurdity, and USA/Mexico subtly maintain that tradition. \u201cEric Carr T-Shirt\u201d is such a hammering trudge that it\u2019s easy to overlook the fact that it\u2019s named for KISS\u2019s hair metal-era drummer; the result feels as appropriate for fans of this megamix of Paul Stanley\u2019s stage banter as Steve Reich\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s Gonna Rain.\u201d\nMatamoros  also  recognizes the city\u2019s fringe noise-rock past and present. Not only do they cover Cherubs\u2019 \u201cShoofly,\u201d they also get Cherubs\u2019 Kevin Whitley to guest on vocals. Spray Paint\u2019s George Dishner lays on even more hellish guitar onto the title track. Austin still feels like a mid-sized college town in some ways, meaning that if you\u2019re into heavy and/or weird music, you\u2019re bound to see the same folks frequently. \u201cVaporwave Headache\u201d breaks through with rapid-fire sheets of abrasive guitar static, and it\u2019s as indebted to Total Abuse\u2019s scathing, bitter hardcore as it is Scratch Acid\u2019s ur-noise rock. It has a punk tempo, but like everything else about USA/Mexico, it is too defiantly weird and alien for pigeonholing. That\u2019s how they fit inside Austin\u2019s storied noise rock and experimental music scenes: by refusing to fit exactly in anywhere.\n", "pptitle": ["matamoro"]}
