The young British producer and visual artist uses asymmetrical rhythms and pattern modulation to pry open the sounds of electro, bleep techno, and speed garage, scattering the components into new shapes that are dazzling and danceable. The results, as on the 2018 standout \u201cPosition_B1,\u201d resemble dance music that has curled back in on itself, forming unsteady sequences that the human brain can just about process.\nTreanor has said that the rhythmic structures on ATAXIA, his debut album, are stricter and more focused than his previous work, exploring apparently contradictory ideas such as \u201cirregular symmetry.\u201d For an artist who once smashed Whigfield\u2019s Eurodance hit \u201cSaturday Night\u201d into an unlikely underground sensation, this shift seems puzzling, and ATAXIA\u2019s weaker tracks suffer from a certain academic dryness. \u201cATAXIA A2\u201d and \u201cATAXIA C1\u201d combine fussily obtuse drum rhythms with sparse machine melodies that spin around in opaque, ever-changing circles, while \u201cATAXIA A1\u201d wastes a wonderfully disjointed beat on a synth melody so understated that it might as well not exist.\nYet the line between success and failure here is cigarette-paper thin. Treanor\u2019s production\u2014a tightly coiled spring of asymmetrical machine beats and dabs of electronic melody\u2014is so distinctive that, aesthetically, little separates the album\u2019s weaker tracks from its out-and-out bangers. \u201cATAXIA B1\u201d is a sonic sibling to \u201cATAXIA A2,\u201d which precedes it. But on \u201cB1\u201d the rhythm is itchily intense, its polyrhythmic vigor playing off against the central synth riff like a murderous ballet that builds in an electrical frenzy.\nAt moments like these, ATAXIA feels wonderfully alive. For all the apparent studiousness in Treanor\u2019s musical methods, he says his music is \u201cintended to make people\u2019s bodies move in unpredictable ways,\u201d a goal reflected, perhaps a little insensitively, in the album\u2019s title. (Common symptoms of ataxia include a lack of coordination and the deterioration of fine motor skills, according to the National Ataxia Foundation.) Certainly, you can imagine a track like \u201cATAXIA D1,\u201d which pits distressed UK garage swing against a nagging riff in the vein of DJ Mujava\u2019s \u201cTownship Funk,\u201d working wonders among clubbers for whom irregular symmetry is less of a concern than the queue for the bar. Best of all, though, is \u201cATAXIA D3,\u201d a track that dispenses with drums in favor of cut-up vocals and insouciant organ stabs that nod to New Jersey garage don (and Daft Punk collaborator) Todd Edwards. It\u2019s here that the album finally comes up for air.\nThere is something rather noble about the way Treanor\u2019s music flirts with failure. If human beings are essentially pattern-finding machines, as Michael Shermer argues in his book How We Believe, then messing with these structures has powerful effects, both positive and negative. Treanor told Resident Advisor that the human ability to recognize patterns in music \u201cmight be why we find some things funky or some things hysterical or some things boring.\u201d ATAXIA has moments of all three, running the gamut across funk, feverish entertainment, and frustratingly dry-eyed experiments. Throughout, however, it remains startlingly original\u2014a powerful piece of work from a sonic adventurer of rare intellectual clarity.\n", "pptitle": ["ataxia"]}
