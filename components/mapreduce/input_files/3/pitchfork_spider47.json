It\u2019s where town native Tom Jenkinson, aka Squarepusher, allegedly played his first show, in 1987, as a 12-year-old with his old band Sub Zero, according to an old bio quoted on the We Are the Music Makers forum. Years later, it\u2019s also where Derwin Dicker, better known as Gold Panda, saw Squarepusher and Aphex Twin perform for about 50 people, even though he didn\u2019t recognize the artists at the time. \u201cThey were both completely under camouflage in a DJ booth,\u201d he recalled in a 2013 interview. \u201cIt was only later that I found out who they were.\u201d\nChelmsford makes an appearance at the top of Jag Trax, a full-length Dicker surprise-released this month under his new alias DJ Jenifa. On album opener \u201cDresscode,\u201d a male voice deadpans, \u201cChelmsford on a Saturday,\u201d over a three-chord keyboard motif with sad-trombone blasts bent wildly out of shape. \u201cWhite shirt. Blue jeans. Brown shoes,\u201d he continues, as though he were Mike Skinner just getting started on yuppie brunch crowds.\nThe track reveals a smirking side of Dicker he hasn\u2019t really shown before, except in interviews, unless you count him titling a track on 2011\u2019s Companion \u201cI Suppose I Should Say Thanks or Some Shit.\u201d While Gold Panda owes as much to Four Tet\u2019s warm, intricate electronics as J Dilla\u2019s masterful sampling, \u201cDresscode\u201d is closer to sardonic house productions like Santiago Salazar\u2019s cool and cutting \u201cYour Club Went Hollywood.\u201d Opening Jag Trax with such a distinctive statement is meant to clearly separate Dicker\u2019s main gig from his side hustle.\nAs Dan Snaith\u2019s Daphni side project is to Caribou, DJ Jenifa is more club-oriented than Gold Panda. Jag Trax is a sleek and propulsive alternative to Dicker\u2019s historically sample-stuffed style. The breathlessly hypnotic single \u201cYou,\u201d off of 2010\u2019s Lucky Shiner, cherry-picks elements from bargain-bin vinyl pressed in India, Mexico, and Japan, while 2013\u2019s Half of Where You Live name-checks Brazil, Hong Kong, and the Japanese island Enoshima. Running these samples through his S950 and Akai MPC, Gold Panda conjures ecstatic, pan-global pinwheels of moods, tone colors, and textures. It\u2019s dance music that can\u2019t be traced to time or place.\nDJ Jenifa\u2019s genealogy is more self-evident. He pledges allegiance to Chicago house (\u201cES1A31Flora\u201d), plays with the intersection of disco and garage (\u201cTrainfilters2\u201d), and serves up lush, hands-high rippers (\u201cWhyileft122\u201d). Still, he doesn\u2019t attempt to fully camouflage who\u2019s behind the moniker. The chiming cymbal taps and beguiling violin figures on \u201cMLL\u201d briefly tricked me into thinking my iTunes had shuffled to Gold Panda, and \u201cWhocares808_7B\u201d wouldn\u2019t be out of place on 2016\u2019s nostalgia collage Good Luck and Do Your Best.\nThough the release seems casual and off-the-cuff\u2014it\u2019s a pay-what-you-wish download with track titles that read like file names\u2014Jag Trax is focused and functional. Kick-and-clap workouts \u201cTuesday\u201d and \u201cTuesdaySTRINGSMIX\u201d are dancefloor tools, for selectors by a selector. But it\u2019s tough, if not impossible, to distinguish the Shazamable highlight of a DJ set on an album\u2019s worth of serviceable house jams. It\u2019s like a toolbox full of screwdrivers: No matter how many variations, or how pretty the candy-colored handles, they\u2019re limited in their utility. Under the guise of DJ Jenifa, Dicker has sacrificed a little bit of the worldly, whimsical charm that makes Gold Panda\u2019s sampledelic Shangri-La worth returning to. At least if you hear one of these tracks pumping out from the DJ booth, you can say you know who\u2019s behind it.\n", "pptitle": ["jag", "trax"]}
