You now have \u201cI\u2019m Me,\u201d a sugar-rush of bubblegum pop from Chai, the four-piece disco-punk band who aspire to destabilize the way beauty and cuteness function in Japan even as they embrace stylized camp and matching outfits.\nThe Nagoya-based band\u2019s second album, PUNK, is terrifically over the top. The current landscape of indie rock produces songs with heavy notes of loss and longing. But Chai is a band who screams yes to joy, and PUNK is a record written in earnest about being yourself, loving your friends, and not caring about what anyone else thinks about the way you live your life. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the world but I know me/I don\u2019t hide my weight,\u201d vocalist Mana sings elsewhere in \u201cI\u2019m Me.\u201d PUNK is full of that kind of bluntly feminist songwriting. If empowerment is uncool, the women of Chai would choose to be uncool every single time.\nChai call equally upon blog house\u2019s halcyon days as they do the ecstatic joy of Downtown new wavers like Lizzy Mercier Descloux and Tom Tom Club. The album\u2019s gleefully overstuffed 30 minutes leave little room to come up for air. Take \u201cGREAT JOB,\u201d which resembles a \u201cDance Dance Revolution\u201d song as heard from the most brightly lit of suburban arcades. Winning combinations on casino slot machines light up, synths mimic the sound of honking car horns, and vocals buzz around the innards of the track like a swarm of bees pollinating a greenhouse. \u201cFashionista\u201d jackhammers its way through neon-lit guitar overdubs while getting serious about the capitalistic impulses of industrial cuteness. \u201cToo much makeup/Just lips and eyebrows all set/Glossy yellow skin/Have nothing more than this,\u201d goes one particularly emblematic line. On \u201cTHIS IS CHAI,\u201d a post-punk track built around a 15-second loop of what sounds like marching band brass, the quartet explores the effects of decay and distortion on the human voice. Listening to the all of the song\u2019s noisy layers come together evokes the sight of a highly pressurized can of whipped cream exploding.\nThe closest Chai come to slowing down is \u201cWintime,\u201d a starry pop song about ringing in the New Year with the people you love, set to synthesizers coated in disco goopiness. As the band shift gears into their most subdued setting, their lyrics travel to deep space: \u201cIn a cold sky the eclipse will laugh/To the point that it\u2019s so bright,\u201d the quartet sings. More than just a song about friendship, \u201cWintime\u201d paints a future where happiness is powerful enough to pull the planets in the night sky out of retrograde.\n", "pptitle": ["punk"]}
