Through a tireless work ethic, Hutchings has become one of the trendiest musicians in all of jazz, and is the leader of a U.K. jazz scene that boasts such names as Nubya Garcia, Moses Boyd, and Theon Cross.\nYet if there\u2019s a flashpoint of Hutchings\u2019 ascendance, it\u2019s 2016, when his other band, the Comet Is Coming, was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize Album of the Year and Shabaka and the Ancestors released an exquisite album called Wisdom of Elders on Gilles Peterson\u2019s Brownswood Recordings label. From there, his name and likeness started appearing everywhere: Hop on his Instagram and Facebook pages, and you\u2019re likely to see Hutchings blaring his sax on stage through grainy video footage, or posing alongside the likes of Kamasi Washington, who\u2019s become a fan of his work. Though Hutchings has been a driving force in the British underground since the early 2010s\u2014having played with a variety of bands, including the punk-focused Melt Yourself Down, and the kaleidoscopic jazz group Polar Bear\u2014it seems the rest of the world is coming around to his magnetic creative artistry.\nOf Hutchings\u2019 groups, the Comet Is Coming reaches farthest, and their new album Trust in the Lifeforce of the Deep Mystery feels directly influenced by the cosmic electronica of Flying Lotus\u2019 Los Angeles and any of Sun Ra\u2019s eccentric jazz. Co-written by Hutchings on sax, Max Hallett on drums, and Dan Leavers on keys, the Comet creates sci-fi-themed blends of jazz painted in dark shades of crimson. Equally nostalgic and progressive, the band mixes the upbeat bounce of 1990s house music with dismal funk and psych-rock, landing on a sound that feels tethered to disaster, like the soundtrack of a party that will soon dissolve. Across this album and the band\u2019s previous work, there\u2019s a sense of cataclysmic despair, that the world is ending and there\u2019s nothing left to do but dance to the apocalypse. If 2017\u2019s Death to the Planet scored Earth\u2019s demise, Lifeforce details its restoration, just as the flames dwindle and the fumes rise from charred soil.\nLifeforce is an album in the truest sense, with each song blending into the next for continuous listening. Mostly low- to mid-tempo, the band skillfully integrates bleak and radiant tones, leading to an impressive nine-track suite of ambient, spoken-word and grime-infused compositions. Take the bookend tracks, \u201cBecause the End Is Really the Beginning\u201d and \u201cThe Universe Wakes Up,\u201d as examples: They\u2019re both weightless, unfolding in a haze of foggy synth chords, faint drum fills and sullen saxophone wails, at once eliciting thoughts of impending doom and possible hope. Other songs feel especially festive: \u201cSummon the Fire,\u201d \u201cSuper Zodiac\u201d and \u201cTimewave Zero\u201d have quick percussion and soaring synth work, and Hutchings accentuates them with turbulent blasts. The saxophonist\u2019s technique centers on high-powered gusts that slowly unfurl until the track\u2019s apex, where he heightens the energy even further with higher-pitched shrieking.\nBy the time \u201cUnity\u201d comes around, Hutchings takes the steam out of his horn, letting the notes flutter as Hallett and Leavers take center stage. On an album of gripping intensity, this song is the most optimistic, soft drums and oscillating synths conveying the deepest notions of peace. \u201cBlood of the Past\u201d is the album\u2019s clear centerpiece and its heaviest track. Here, the trio produces a menacing instrumental on which poet Kate Tempest delivers a finger-wagging verse to, well, everything\u2014vanity, capitalism, social disconnection, and nonchalance. She speaks the only words we hear on the album, crystallizing the Comet\u2019s masterful release with blunt force impact. \u201cImagine a culture that has at its root a more soulful connection to land, and to lovers,\u201d Tempest ponders. \u201c...Unable to listen, we keep speaking \u2026 unable to notice ourselves, unable to stop and unwilling to learn.\u201d The Comet\u2019s point becomes clear in that moment: Earth\u2019s demise isn\u2019t due to some fiery blast you\u2019d see in a movie, it\u2019s due to the erosion of common decency, and our allegiance to superficial items that validate our existence. Lifeforce is a plea to stay human, and most of all, humane.\n", "pptitle": ["trust", "lifeforc", "deep", "mysteri"]}
