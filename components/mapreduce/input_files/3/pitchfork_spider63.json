In his hands, the insistent 4/4 pulse assumes a sinister shape, like \u201cKilling Eve\u201d\u2019s Villanelle moving through a packed club with a shiv at the ready. For much of his career thus far, the 31-year-old has released nasty-sounding music through a small Montreal record label, but his profile skyrocketed after co-producing Kanye West\u2019s titanic Yeezus cuts \u201cBlack Skinhead\u201d and \u201cSend It Up.\u201d\nAt its most ferocious, the still-inimitable Yeezus sounded like a thousand car-crash videos auto-playing in the same browser window\u2014precisely why L\u00e9vy\u2019s highway-pileup sonics fit in so well. A Gesaffelstein banger isn\u2019t something you can simply walk away from; you practically require the Jaws of Life to extricate yourself. His rude and rumbling 2013 debut capitalized off his Yeezus moment (even though, technically speaking, it had been recorded two years before) with \u00fcber-aggressive singles like \u201cPursuit\u201d and \u201cHate or Glory\u201d and moments of simmering ambient reflection that nodded to another dimension of his palette. He elaborated on this subtler side with his work on the Weeknd\u2019s My Dear Melancholy,; \u201cI Was Never There\u201d slowed a G-funk whine to a creeping slither, and \u201cHurt You\u201d gave off a muted glow similar to the Weeknd\u2019s Daft Punk collab \u201cI Feel It Coming.\u201d\nThe aesthetic connections between L\u00e9vy and Daft Punk don\u2019t end there; for one, they\u2019re labelmates now. Some of the hardest-hitting Gesaffelstein material resembles a \u2019roided-out take on the brutalist house and hip-hop that Daft Punk explored on Homework. The second Gesaffelstein album and first for Columbia, Hyperion, is L\u00e9vy\u2019s attempt to channel the more accessible side of the robot duo, featuring futuristic pop with vocal collaborations ranging from the Weeknd and Pharrell to Haim and Toronto synth-pop duo Electric Youth (of Drive soundtrack fame). Hyperion feels more meticulously crafted than Aleph, sequenced to evoke a journey not dissimilar to Daft Punk\u2019s own pop-as-Epcot ride Random Access Memories from 2013.\nEven with a decade of experience under his belt, though, Hyperion suggests that L\u00e9vy isn\u2019t quite ready to make the professional leap that the album supposedly represents. Its strongest tracks are immediate, both in impact and sequencing; the title track whirrs and oscillates with lovely synths spiraling into eternity, while \u201cReset\u201d is the platonic Gesaffelstein experience\u2014wonky, hip-hop-inflected electronic music with its own respiratory system, sounding as if angry turbines learned how to breathe. The Weeknd collab \u201cLost in the Fire\u201d marks the pair\u2019s most effective team-up to date: Abel Tesfaye\u2019s MJ-isms blend so seamlessly with L\u00e9vy\u2019s inky backgrounds that it might take a listen or two to suss out the rank homophobia of Tesfaye\u2019s typically drab lyrical attempts at lasciviousness.\nHyperion\u2019s other guest spots aren\u2019t as successful\u2014evidence that his jet black range could use a wider color palette. The relative failure of these crossover attempts is more damning considering that the artists in question have more effectively collaborated with mainstream dance figures in the past; the stiff, mid-tempo Electric Youth cut \u201cForever\u201d doesn\u2019t come close to achieving the weightless glory of their iconic \u201cA Real Hero\u201d with French producer David Grellier\u2019s College project, while Haim\u2019s contributions to the misty \u201cSo Bad\u201d lacks the impact of their performance on Calvin Harris\u2019 2015 single \u201cPray to God.\u201d\nEven \u201cLost in the Fire\u201d and the Pharrell-featuring \u201cBlast Off\u201d\u2014two songs featuring frequent Daft Punk collaborators\u2014can\u2019t help but come across as budget-level attempts to replicate past glories from other artists. If it seems unfair to judge Hyperion\u2019s weaknesses against the work of L\u00e9vy\u2019s supposed peers, it\u2019s equally frustrating that he hasn\u2019t yet given us a real idea of who he is as an artist. He didn\u2019t invent the rough-and-tumble approach to techno that most know him for, and the churning instrumentals of Hyperion would\u2019ve sounded at home amidst the grab-bag Aleph\u2014proof, maybe, that while he has consistency on his side, true artistic evolution remains out of L\u00e9vy\u2019s reach.\n", "pptitle": ["hyperion"]}
