0.13869047619047617, "content": "Billie Eilish has suddenly become an obscenely famous pop star\u2014the kind with 15 million Instagram followers, sold-out shows around the world, a haute modeling contract, and couch time with Ellen DeGeneres. Her brilliance is an obvious truth; just ask any teenager in America as they wait patiently for the rest of the world to catch up to their consummate taste in pop music.\nOf course, the 17-year-old Eilish is still waiting for her teeth to straighten out. This fact trumpets the arrival of her debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?: For its intro, Eilish removes her much-loathed transparent braces in a series of lightly gross, ASMR-worthy slurps, and proclaims, \u201cI have taken out my Invisalign and this is the album.\u201d She then dissolves into heaving cackles, the kind that alienates any onlookers too prissy to partake. There are several more oddball moments like this\u2014absent-minded humming to a track, giggling asides\u2014that remind us she\u2019s still a precocious, creative teen girl on this rocket, and all her gothic proclivities don\u2019t cancel out how much she\u2019s enjoying the ride.\nHer rise has been striking: At 14, she put the song \u201cOcean Eyes\u201d on SoundCloud, a glassy, straightforward ballad with tearful synths and woozy, Lana Del Rey-indebted crooning. She snared a young fanbase with her hooks and raised her middle finger to pop\u2019s status quo; here was this music that shifted between genres\u2014from pop to trap and EDM\u2014made by a lawless young female singer sporting baggy, androgynous clothes. She cast her bored, listless eyes upward instead of batting them at the camera. She filled her videos with flowing black tears, plunging needles, and arachnid hors d\u2019oeuvres instead of twirling around sleek cityscapes. Eilish\u2019s creepy eccentricity feels so removed from the pop formula; it helps distance her from the music industry\u2019s historically lewd maceration of teen idols. Eilish just seems sharper, meaner, more self-sufficient\u2014a young star from Los Angeles, in the grand tradition, but one that could only have come along while its hills are burning.\nThe best moments of When We All Fall Asleep play firmly into this formula. Inspired by Eilish\u2019s frequent night terrors and lucid dreams, the album juggles dark compulsions with grim eulogies, balancing her feathery vocals with deep, grisly bass. Like her spirit animal, the spider, Eilish can weave something that is at once delicate and grotesque: In \u201cyou should see me in a crown,\u201d she lulls the listener into a false idyll with her murmured lilt, then leaps off the cliff of a tectonic dubstep bass drop, her sneer fully audible. (That the title is cribbed from Moriarty, the beguiling psychopath of television\u2019s \u201cSherlock,\u201d also speaks to her pull toward the sinister.)\n\u201cxanny\u201d plumbs sincere anxiety over more marrow-shaking bass, the kind that could blast apart a few pairs of headphones. Eilish\u2019s voice crossfades over the narcoleptic beat, and slips into full despair, whimpering her most self-aware lines on the record: \u201cPlease don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk/On your cigarette break/I can\u2019t afford to love someone/Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake.\u201d Eilish\u2019s lyrics wonderfully underscore how all teen angst is both fiercely sincere and an affect of being only partially informed.\nA similar spirit drives \u201cbury a friend,\u201d another early single. Despite the vocoder-style distortion, Eilish\u2019s voice feels even more intimate as she hisses, \u201cStep on the glass, staple your tongue\u201d in a farcical singsong. Eilish has namechecked Tyler, the Creator as one of her greatest influences; in her slightly jazzy trill, too, she also nods to her clearest pop progenitor, Lorde, who cleared much of Eilish\u2019s path with her autonomous creative control, heavy-lidded social observations, and blithely goth aura.\nStill, all Eilish\u2019s weaponry can\u2019t stop her most overtly pop track, \u201cbad guy,\u201d from going stale. A snappy pulse launches Eilish into a litany of taunts against her partner. Over the rubbery electro beat, she says she\u2019s the \u201cmake-your-girlfriend-mad type/Might-seduce-your-dad type.\u201d It gave me pause because it suggests that perhaps Eilish isn\u2019t so far removed from the teen pop continuum as we\u2019ve come to believe: How different is her bragging about statutory rape, culturally, from trussing up 16-year-old Britney Spears in pigtails and plaid? Even if it\u2019s a teen girl\u2019s decision, entirely, to flaunt her sexuality (or engage in provocative roleplay), the line crosses a boundary plenty of adults were happy to cosign.\nThe quieter moments of When We Fall Asleep nod more to Eilish\u2019s past, and to mixed results. Much like her first EP, 2017\u2019s Don\u2019t Smile at Me, they skew glum instead of macabre, even briefly twee. \u201cwish you were gay\u201d spotlights Eilish\u2019s vocals, which deserved better than being spackled with canned studio laughter and self-involved lyrics in the lamentable lineage of Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cUr So Gay.\u201d Minimalist, mournful piano ballads like \u201clisten before i go\u201d and \u201cwhen the party\u2019s over\u201d further prove her vocal talents amid larger inertia. Throw in a cheeky, extended riff on an episode of \u201cThe Office\u201d on \u201cmy strange addiction\u201d\u2014which smatters in clips of the Dunder Mifflin crew reacting to Michael Scott\u2019s own contentious creative efforts\u2014and you have an album as widely collagist as a teen\u2019s bedroom wall.\n", "pptitle": ["fall", "asleep"]}
