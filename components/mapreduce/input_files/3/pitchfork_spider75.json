In what is essentially one long run-on sentence, \u201cGirl\u201d takes the form of a stern mother\u2019s list of instructions to her daughter on how to become a skilled, self-possessed woman (\u201cthis is how you sweep a whole house; this is how you sweep a yard; this is how you smile to someone you don\u2019t like too much; this is how you smile to someone you don\u2019t like at all\u201d). The litany is imbued with both intense maternal love and unsparing criticism, an imbalance that reflects a colonialist structure that Kincaid sharply excoriates in writing. \u201cI\u2019ve come to see that I\u2019ve worked through the relationship of the mother and the girl to a relationship between Europe and the place that I\u2019m from,\u201d Kincaid explained to Mississippi Review in 1996. \u201cWhich is to say, a relationship between the powerful and the powerless.\u201d\nThat metaphorical relationship, between a powerful forebear and powerless descendants, colors much of This Is How You Smile, Roberto Carlos Lange\u2019s sixth and best album under his Helado Negro moniker. Following 2016\u2019s Private Energy, an album that wrestled with violence against people of color through electronic-pop meditations on identity and connection, Smile takes Kincaid\u2019s weary passion and wanders through soothing, ambling soundscapes, framed as a stroll with Lange\u2019s older brother down the sun-baked streets of South Florida, where they grew up. The album deepens and expands upon the imagistic nature of Lange\u2019s lyrics and cosmic synth-folk, using found sound and his own sonorous, humming voice to tease out the complicated harmony of love and power at the heart of Kincaid\u2019s short story.\nThese sublime confessions are fixated on perseverance, of embracing joy and laughter while facing the everyday difficulties of growing up in an immigrant household. \u201cBlush now/They can\u2019t know/Lifelong history shows,\u201d Lange sings over gently chiming vibraphone on the opener \u201cPlease Won\u2019t Please,\u201d \u201cThat brown won\u2019t go/Brown just glows.\u201d The song picks up the thread of Private Energy\u2019s \u201cYoung, Latin and Proud\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s My Brown Skin,\u201d centering Lange\u2019s experience of living as a Latinx person with plain-spoken lyrics of support and encouragement. That tender intention paves the way for the rest of This Is How You Smile\u2019s open-hearted solicitude.\nSynths glow like footlights on \u201cPa\u00eds Nublado,\u201d a bilingual exploration of uncertainty and the persistence of spirit: \u201cLaughing longer/Smiling harder/Makes me feel/Feeling stronger,\u201d he lists in a soothing croon. The gray, overcast imagery of a \u201cpa\u00eds nublado\u201d (\u201ccloudy country\u201d) represents a precarious future, addressing a widespread present-day fear and choosing to offer a blanket of relief rather than resignation.\nLange employs stretches of fuzzy cellphone recordings and ambient meditations to temper other encroaching anxieties. \u201cFantasma Vaga\u201d sinks comfortably into a spectral, twitchy pool of echoed synths. \u201cModulaci\u00f3nes en t\u00fa sonrisa/Desplazamiento que no puedo imitar (Modulation in your smile/Displacement that I can\u2019t imitate),\u201d Lange sings placidly over watery cassette synthesizers, speaking to several experiences of displacement\u2014deportation and gentrification among them\u2014at once. \u201cY t\u00fa cambias todo,\u201d he repeats at the song\u2019s end, the music clearing around him like a receding fog. Highlight \u201cRunning\u201d is of the same cloth, incorporating a hazy, recursive song structure that pivots around Lange\u2019s chanting of the title. He is adept at suggesting an optimistic form of escapism from worry, distinct in its uplift.\nThis Is How You Smile\u2019s finely drawn intimacy can be attributed to Lange\u2019s familial sense of collaboration. A crew of Latinx artists breathes life into the album\u2019s corners: members of the loungey Puerto Rican duo Buscabulla and Providence punk group Downtown Boys appear on backing vocals, as well as Xenia Rubinos and rising Colombian electronic artist Ela Minus. Longtime collaborator Sufjan Stevens adds to the brief \u201cNovember 7,\u201d transmuting sampled piano into the sounds of a quavering, peaceful grotto, while Wye Oak\u2019s Jenn Wasner threads hypnotic electric guitar through the lithe, bounding \u201cSeen My Aura.\u201d Yet none of This Is How You Smile sounds cluttered or overwrought; each appearance is in service of Lange\u2019s cocooning vision, like a cast of supporting characters fleshing out the broader theme of forging closeness with yourself and others within a politically and socially tumultuous time.\nThe list of how-tos in Kincaid\u2019s \u201cGirl\u201d invokes a mother\u2019s wisdom, regardless of how flawed or mistaken it may be. Lange, however, seems to be taking on the role of both the parent and the child receiving instruction across This Is How You Smile. The relationship between the powerful and the powerless is revealed here in the gentle and generous refutation of mandates we\u2019ve been told to abide by to succeed in life, whether as Latinx people, as American citizens, or as human beings. He reassures listeners that both power and potential exist as guiding voices within each of us, if we take the time to slow down and listen.\n", "pptitle": ["smile"]}
