He certainly gave the music business his best shot, traveling from his native Texas to Nashville to cut a series of albums for the tiny label Poppy between 1968 and 1972, frequently collaborating with Jack Clement, a producer who decided to ostentatiously augment the songwriter\u2019s eccentricities instead of accentuate them. It wasn\u2019t a winning formula commercially, and his lack of success during his only prolific period helped fate him to decades of wandering on the margins of country and Americana. Hits came for other people\u2014Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson took \u201cPancho and Lefty\u201d to the top of Billboard\u2019s country charts in 1987\u2014but not for Van Zandt, who wound up amassing not so much a body of work as a deep, varied songbook, which could be brought to life either by himself or other singers.\nOn Sky Blue, a posthumous album released the week he would\u2019ve turned 75, underscores the notion of a songbook, Townes Van Zandt rifles through his drafts and recent work, punctuating his original work with covers. Van Zandt recorded the 11 tracks that comprise Sky Blue in 1973 with Bill Hedgepeth, a journalist who also was one of the singer-songwriter\u2019s buddies. At the time, Van Zandt had just wrapped up his run at Poppy with The Late Great Townes Van Zandt. Nobody knew it at the time, but there was more than a kernel of truth in that title. It took him five years to return to action with 1978\u2019s Flyin\u2019 Shoes\u2014the same span of time in which he had churned out six records for Poppy. Such long gaps between albums became standard operating procedure for Van Zandt, with the singer-songwriter buying time and generating cash by putting out the occasional live album, such as the celebrated 1977 LP Live at the Old Quarter, Houston, Texas.\nThe set captured on Live at the Old Quarter was recorded in 1973, the same year Van Zandt cut the material that wound up on Sky Blue. Both albums were made at the outset of Van Zandt\u2019s years of rambling, so they share a sense of freshness and immediacy; he\u2019s hardly brimming with optimism but he\u2019s yet to be hardened by the alcoholism that later took his life. On Live at the Old Quarter, he\u2019s blessed by the addition of an audience, whose very presence cajoles Van Zandt to display the wry sense of playfulness that\u2019s so often overlooked within his work. There\u2019s no such chance of such understated humor surfacing on Sky Blue, however. Recorded on his lonesome at Hedgepeth\u2019s home studio, Van Zandt is singing to himself. He runs no risk of unexpected digressions, unless the choice of songs counts.\nOn that front, Sky Blue offers a few surprises, chief among them two unheard Van Zandt originals. \u201cAll I Need\u201d opens the album on a soft, wistful note, achieving a comforting melancholy sway that\u2019s countered by the delicate, bruised \u201cSky Blue,\u201d which barely keeps the sadness at bay. Neither are major items but that\u2019s their appeal: They\u2019re finely-etched yet modest, the product of a songwriter who remains dedicated to the craft. In that light, it\u2019s easy to hear his covers of Richard Dobson\u2019s \u201cForever for Always for Certain\u201d and Tom Paxton\u2019s \u201cThe Last Thing on My Mind,\u201d along with the traditional folk tune \u201cHills of Roane County,\u201d as roundabout inspirations, song where Van Zandt began exploring ideas he\u2019d later develop on his own, but within the context of Sky Blue, they help make the album feel a bit like an intimate live set. Van Zandt may not be playing for punters but he\u2019s playing songs that would suit a small, attentive crowd, balancing covers, favorites (\u201cPancho and Lefty,\u201d then new but already seeming like a classic) and newer songs.\nMuch of Sky Blue\u2019s charm derives from how it doesn\u2019t quite slide into any particular category. It\u2019s neither a live album nor an album of its own, yet it\u2019s also not a set of demos for a forthcoming record. Instead, it\u2019s a vivid snapshot of a particular moment, preserving a time when he had yet to fritter away his good will, and capturing Townes Van Zandt when it still seemed like he was on the verge of great things.\n", "pptitle": ["sky", "blue"]}
