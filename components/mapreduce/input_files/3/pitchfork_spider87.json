To kick off his first full-length in five years, the platinum-selling Irish singer-songwriter celebrates the legends who spoke truth to power, as he shouts out a veritable VH1 marathon\u2019s worth of greats: Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, John Lennon, James Brown, Joni Mitchell, Mavis Staples, Patti Smith, Marvin Gaye, and more are name-checked during the opening song \u201cNina Cried Power.\u201d The message is simple. All of these people made a difference, and, whoever you are, wherever you are, at least one of them probably means something to you. Why dwell in hopelessness when you can join the choir?\nIt\u2019s a well-meaning call to action that\u2019s paid dividends in the past. \u201cTake Me to Church\u201d is both the title of Hozier\u2019s career-making 2013 single and also his imagined purpose as a songwriter\u2014a purveyor of good will, packaged in radio anthems designed to be sung at the top of your lungs. In his music and interviews, the soft-spoken 28-year-old is passionate about noble causes, from LGBTQ awareness to the Irish nurses\u2019 strike and the opioid crisis. Standing at six-foot-five, with chiseled features and the occasional man-bun, the mononymic singer even has a kind of Christ-like aura, or at least downmarket Russell Brand. His mother, the visual artist Raine Hozier-Byrne, designed his latest album cover in a process that involved submerging her son underwater for extended periods of time: \u201cI had said to mum,\u201d he joked dryly, \u201cJust try to think of the album sales if I do die on this shoot!\u201d\nAnother thing: he\u2019s got a gorgeous voice. Booming and effervescent, it\u2019s an instrument that communicates passion, adventure, and wisdom, all to the extent that transcribing his lyrics seems to be somewhat missing the point. There\u2019s a reason why most people didn\u2019t realize that \u201cTake Me to Church\u201d is a protest song about the Catholic Church. Like Foster the People\u2019s similarly out-of-nowhere smash \u201cPumped Up Kicks,\u201d it seemed to ascend the charts solely on hummable hooks and crowd-pleasing adrenaline. Such strengths are a sweet but elusive currency. Analyze a beautiful day and it\u2019s already over. At 14 tracks in roughly an hour, Wasteland, Baby! falls prey to the humdrum, all its power wrung dry.\nThe record\u2019s pitfalls are nothing new for major-label artists attempting to follow a surprise hit. Nearly every element of \u201cTake Me to Church\u201d is isolated and recycled here in the hopes of crowning a successor: God is not in the house. The aid of a gospel choir doesn\u2019t make the awkward one-word refrain of \u201cTo Noise Making (Sing)\u201d sound like something worth singing along to, just as the slow-build, stomp-clap murk of \u201cMovement\u201d mostly invites you to avert eye contact from the back of the room. Even just the central refrains of these songs\u2014Sing! Move! Now!\u2014suggest an unbecoming directness. Rock stars make us want to join in on the fun; wedding singers and youth group leaders demand it.\nHozier has always had a subtle dark streak, and you can sense him trying to wield his moods in new ways. He now deals in spacier arrangements, heavier guitars, and harsher lyrics. (\u201cNo Plan\u201d takes aim at the \u201cscreaming, heaving fuckery of the world.\u201d Hoo-ah!) Most successful is a ballad called \u201cShrike\u201d that also appeared on last year\u2019s Nina Cried Power EP. It\u2019s stark and fingerpicked, with gestures toward traditional Irish folk music. His bellowed vocals exude a down-home intimacy that makes me consider the strange path that led us toward pop music that sounds like this. It maybe begins with the Black Keys and Danger Mouse\u2019s lite psychedelic blues and weaves through the Lumineers\u2019 audience-participation folk-pop; it rides in the sidecar of Adele\u2019s torch ballad supernovas and stops just short of Alabama Shakes\u2019 riotous pearly gates. It wants badly to sound timeless but it already feels like a moment that\u2019s passed. Ed Sheeran and James Bay, two of Hozier\u2019s peers, have attempted to evolve by writing fake Rihanna songs and cutting their hair, respectively. Hozier\u2019s unease about the future is palpable.\nThe way Hozier tells it, he wrote Wasteland, Baby!\u2019s title track after reading how threats of nuclear war caused the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to move our doomsday clock ahead 30 seconds\u2014an event that resulted in the BBC using the word \u201capocalypse\u201d in a headline. And yet, he sees a little light. \u201cAll the fear and fire of the end of the world,\u201d he sings gently, \u201cHappens each time a boy falls in love with a girl.\u201d He\u2019s not the first songwriter to lament the small apocalypses that occur every day, or how love\u2019s temporal nature is also what makes it special. And to hear him sing it\u2014his voice coated in an unearthly burble atop humble, fingerpicked acoustic guitar\u2014is to hear him acknowledge his limitations. After all, churches are where we celebrate life\u2019s fiery beginnings and endings, but the truth is, we spend most of our time somewhere in the middle, consumed by an earnest and unglamorous everyday kind of searching. Without meaning or direction, it might, given a voice, sound something like this.\n", "pptitle": ["wasteland", "babi"]}
