Co-founders Korn\u00e9l Kov\u00e1cs, Pedrodollar, and Axel Boman all delivered reliably off-kilter takes on their twinkling brand of house music; Kompakt\u2019s Superpitcher jumpstarted a senior center\u2019s AM radio with some help from a battered drum machine; and Baba Stiltz did his stoned lothario bit. But virtually everyone on the record\u2014even DJ Koze, whose ambient beats took on an unusually opalescent glow\u2014was upstaged by Sofia Kourtesis\u2019 bewitching \u201cWinWin San.\u201d With easy-listening vocal harmonies looping dreamily above garbled voices and a deceptively bass-heavy house groove, the song swirled like a cotton-candy kaleidoscope.\nThat was Kourtesis\u2019 first appearance on wax, save for a guest vocal on Gold Panda\u2019s \u201cHalf of Where You Live,\u201d in 2013; now, just six months later, the Peruvian-born, Berlin-based musician returns with a debut EP that\u2019s every bit as magical. It\u2019s easy to see what the Studio Barnhus label hears in her. Like the imprint\u2019s founders\u2014and like Koze himself, whose offbeat, low-key sensibility provided the blueprint for the Stockholm crew\u2019s whole aesthetic\u2014she makes house music that skirts convention and renounces rote functionality without ever forgetting that its purpose is to make people move.\nHer tracks bound all over the place. Steady kick drums suddenly buckle at the knees; scrappy accents tug at the beat\u2019s already lopsided center of gravity. Her drum programming, which seems to have been cobbled together from mismatched drum-machine hits, rickety breaks, and percussive abstractions, amounts to a hyperkinetic hodge-podge of clinks, clanks, zaps, and pows\u2014a veritable comic book\u2019s worth of onomatopoeia.\nA sense of mystery runs through all four songs, beginning with the cloudy circumstances of their very genesis. There\u2019s no telling exactly how they were made, but they sound largely sample-based. In \u201cLana Gaye,\u201d a dramatic strip of harmonized vocals is chopped up\u2014possibly backwards, though it\u2019s hard to tell for sure\u2014over a beat that rattles like a stick against a washboard. In \u201cTrains & Airports,\u201d a half-sung, half-shouted call-and-response refrain triggers memories of Ricardo Villalobos\u2019 Christian Vander-sampling \u201cEnfants (Chants).\u201d Often, a wordless vocal loop becomes an overstuffed bed of tone that incidental elements get bounced off of, like quarters tossed on a lumpy mattress.\nThere\u2019s always something just out of earshot, just past the limits of comprehension: garbled street noise, a snatch of overheard dialogue in another language, a yelp that might be a hiccup. In \u201cIos Santos,\u201d the EP\u2019s most placid cut, what might be a market vendor\u2019s cry briefly harmonizes with the song\u2019s melodic elements, an inspired bit of collage that reveals the music hidden in everyday life.\nKourtesis says that many of her sounds come from her travels\u2014the din of the Amazon, the shouts of children selling papa y queso\u2014while others come from movies, old records, or children\u2019s toys from the flea market. None of these techniques are new, but, putting them in the service of such expressive melodies and surprising arrangements, she makes them wholly her own. This is as playful and as spirited as house music gets. It\u2019s not enough, she seems to say, to make people move; Kourtesis\u2019 songs make a compelling argument that the real purpose of dance music is to make people dream.\n", "pptitle": ["sofia", "kourtesi", "ep"]}
