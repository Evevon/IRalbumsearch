No songwriter has induced that feeling as uncannily over the last half-decade as Sun Kil Moon\u2019s Mark Kozelek. Since 2014\u2019s wide-ranging and discursive Benji, he\u2019s doubled down on talk for talk\u2019s sake, sharing ever-longer monologues increasingly devoid of irony, comic coincidence, payoffs, or takeaways, all delivered at the slumberous pace of those first 15 minutes of Marc Maron\u2019s podcast that everybody skips.\nBuilding on the audacious banality of last year\u2019s This Is My Dinner, Kozelek\u2019s latest 90-minute dispatch of unedited thoughts I Also Want To Die in New Orleans goes a step further by framing his ramblings as a kind of free jazz. Recorded with Dirty Three drummer Jim White and Donny McCaslin, the saxophonist who helped drive David Bowie\u2019s Blackstar to transcendence, the record has a limber, late-night session vibe that sets it apart from its predecessors, but anybody coming for the tasteful playing of those accompanists is seriously overestimating Kozelek\u2019s restraint. Hardly a second goes by that isn\u2019t usurped by the drone of his indiscriminate, run-on narration.\nEach of these seven songs feels like a Jim\u2019s Journal comic stretched to the length of a Tolstoy novel. The 15-minute \u201cDay in America\u201d opens with news of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, but that grave backdrop gives way to a pedestrian account of a show: Some musicians sit in with Kozelek\u2019s trio, one of them plays a Bill Evans song that Kozelek thinks is brilliant, but he\u2019s furious when he learns it\u2019s a cover, imagining the fallout if he\u2019d unknowingly released it as his own (\u201cSomeone would have called me out and said, \u2018You ripped off Bill Evans!\u2019\u201d). This goes on for minutes. And then, for no other reason than Bill Evans sounds like Bob Evans, Kozelek details a bad night he had at that chain restaurant when he was 18, which also goes on for minutes. The song ends with a dream sequence.\nAnd amazingly that\u2019s the most eventful song on New Orleans. On the 23-minute \u201cBay of Kotor\u201d he pets some sickly kittens, and imitates various animal cries and barks. \u201cCows\u201d considers his relationship with meat: \u201cTo give up cow flesh entirely, completely, at this stage in my life, I\u2019m afraid would be very hard for me/For half a century I\u2019ve enjoyed the tasty flavor of cow meat/It tastes so good in my mom\u2019s chop suey.\u201d One of the few songs with a pulse, \u201cCouch Potato\u201d squanders a fluttery, jazzed-out Modest Mouse groove on Kozelek\u2019s ornery political musings and #UnpopularOpinions. Sure, Trump is terrible, he maintains, but Obama separated immigrant children from their parents, too. Never mind that fact checkers beg to differ; fact-checking a song that also includes a dicey aside about Obama\u2019s light skin is wasted energy.\nDespite their periodic flirtations with lofty subjects, these songs are deliberately inconsequential, flimsy excuses for Kozelek\u2019s assault of superfluous details, circuitous dialogue, and dead-end asides. The individual parts rarely mean anything, and the whole means even less. Benji\u2019s great trick was its songs only seemed meandering\u2014its winding tales gave way to emotional revelations that were all the more moving because Kozelek sounded like he was processing them in real time. But the songwriting style that seemed so brave on that album feels more than ever like a cowardly cheat on I Also Want To Die in New Orleans, a preemptive attempt by an artist running short on ideas to shield himself from criticism by feigning indifference. After all, you can\u2019t fail if you were never really trying, and from the blurry photo of a cat on its cover to its afterthought of a title, lifted from a poster he saw for last year\u2019s $uicideboy$ album, and the miserable slog of the songs themselves, Kozelek never stops telegraphing how little he cares.\n", "pptitle": ["want", "die", "new", "orlean"]}
