A melody had popped into his head while he was driving; during the standstill, he called home and sang it into his answering machine, he remembers. At the time, Japan was still in the grips of \u201cThe Lost Decade,\u201d a period of economic downturn following the inflated tech optimism and conspicuous consumption of the 1980s. Y2K anxiety was gathering momentum. Amid the stress of busy city streets, the melody harbored a yearning for the reflective pleasures and possibilities of meandering. The little tune eventually grew into \u201cOpus,\u201d the opening track of Sakamoto\u2019s mid-career solo piano album, BTTB.\nBTTB, an acronym for \u201cBack to the Basics,\u201d has generally been remembered as homage: Sakamoto doing Satie, painting impressionistic scenes to speak to the subconscious. Memory, however, has a tendency to behave like water\u2014one minute flooding the senses, the next smoothing away details. In BTTB\u2019s case, the weirder, more prescient, and occasionally humorous moments have been washed from the public record. To be fair, the album\u2019s form was fluid from the start. First released in Japan in November 1998 with 14 tracks, it was reissued just four months later with the addition of the somber \u201cSnake Eyes\u201d and a four-handed piano version of the 1979 song \u201cTong Poo,\u201d from Sakamoto\u2019s hugely influential Yellow Magic Orchestra. Subsequent European and U.S. versions did away with some experimental tracks to make room for more commercial offerings.\nThis new 20th-anniversary edition feels like Sakamoto\u2019s director\u2019s cut. With 18 tracks, it combines the 1999 Japanese release with two cuts from the 2000 stateside version: the ad-soundtrack-turned-hit-single \u201cEnergy Flow\u201d and a beautifully looping closer called \u201cReversing.\u201d At odds with much of the plaintive piano playing, \u201cDo Bacteria Sleep,\u201d omitted from European and U.S. releases, uses a mouth harp to bring to life a microscopic world of sound. The mouth harp\u2019s peculiar vibrations decay at more or less the same rate as a piano\u2019s notes, so the track\u2019s mid-album position offers a palate cleanser within the stream of familiar sounds. Still, the curio reminds the listener of the piano\u2019s stringed interior, the mechanics of its timeless appeal.\nAs if to emphasize the point, Sakamoto lifts the piano\u2019s lid on a trio of compositions during the album\u2019s back half, using a prepared piano to channel Satie via John Cage. During \u201cPrelude,\u201d rubber erasers blunt the vibrations of the piano strings, conjuring a xylophone rusting in a well. \u201cSonata\u201d applies a similar process to a tripled pace, forcing the overlapping notes into dissonance. The energy suggests the mating call of some undiscovered bird, tripping over itself to find a receptive partner.\n\u201cUetax\u201d raised the most eyebrows among classical listeners and critics expecting only pretty piano pieces. Watery gurgles, not unlike a stomach mid-digestion, obscure a very faint voice. One imagines a mic inside a container of water atop the piano strings; the track even shares a name with a waterproof microphone designed for hurricane conditions. But the process is less important than the feeling\u2014in its swerving of convention, it tickles and delights. It also clears the way for \u201cAqua,\u201d a piano version of a synth instrumental Sakamoto wrote for an album by his daughter, Miu. It is as close to balladry as BTTB gets.\n\u201cUetax\u201d and its prepared piano siblings predict Sakamoto\u2019s 2017 album, async, which found him in an introspective yet adventurously ambient zone; their reintroductions here are reminders that he\u2019s been breaking boundaries between music and mere sound for decades. While the fingers of Ravel, Brahms, and, yes, Satie all amble alongside Sakamoto\u2019s on BTTB, his appetite for nesting experimental sonics within atmospheric meanderings mark the album as a contemporary treasure. Snatching a moment of pause, BTTB suggests, is the surest path to a fresh perspective.\n", "pptitle": ["bttb", "20th", "anniversari", "edit"]}
