Internet guitarist-vocalist Steve Lacy helps out, as Ezra Koenig sings abstractedly about a garden that somehow recalls the one St. Stephen trafficked in that Grateful Dead song, with a gear shift into sunny soul-pop on the chorus, which involves a \u201cstrange thought upon the pillow.\u201d The whole thing hopscotches by in a blur, and is over in 2:18 \u2014 at which point you want to hear it again.\r\n\r\nThe video, directed by Jonah Hill, is fittingly woozy, with a split-screen, spiraling point-of-view. In a charming touch for a band that always rooted its internationalism in home turf, the clip depicts Koenig apparently giving Lacy a tour of his fave brunch spots, the iconic New York City Upper West Side lox-and-bagel temples Zabar\u2019s and Barney Greengrass. At the latter, homeboy Jerry Seinfeld turns up, kibbitzing over a display case of smoked fish and halvah. Fab Five Freddy and some adorable puppies are also involved. You\u2019ll leave hungry for a nosh, and for the album, which so far is sounding great.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKDesEcDrcc", "pptitle": ["song", "need", "know", "vampir", "weekend", "sunflow", "roll", "stone"]}
