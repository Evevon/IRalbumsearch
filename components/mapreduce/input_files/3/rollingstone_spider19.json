This was one reason, according to the press release for his new album, that he gave \u201ca wide berth\u201d to rave culture in the following decade; he was also busy making several classic indie-rock albums with Pavement at the time. But a few years ago, Malkmus was living in Berlin when he started exploring the city\u2019s club scene and developed an affinity for techno. This was the germ for his new electronic album, Groove Denied, on which one of rock\u2019s great guitar poets messes with synths, drum machines and a vaguely British accent.\r\n\r\nMalkmus played all the parts on Groove Denied himself, using, among other things, Ableton software, a Moog, a mellotron, and \u201cE drums with addictive drums.\u201d Key influences, according to a recent Rolling Stone interview, include the Human League, \u201cLouie Louie\u201d and - hey, why not - the cantina scene in Star Wars. There\u2019s a satisfying sense of discovery to the more electronic tunes, of a laid-back icon finding new ways to make noise after the kids have gone to bed. Mostly instrumental opener \u201cBelziger Faceplant\u201d burbles along before opening up into hard-grooving electro-funk; \u201cViktor Borgia\u201d is arch, circa-1982 synth-pop; the swirling \u201cForget Your Place\u201d sounds cool through headphones.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlC8uz47qGo\r\n\r\nMalkmus wrote most of the album a few years back, but Matador declined to release it until the label had put out last year\u2019s Sparkle Hard, which featured his longtime band the Jicks. That album was light on the wry humor Malkmus is known for; Groove Denied feels like a more playful companion. But it isn\u2019t a massive departure from his past work. For one thing, its emphasis on texture and sonic exploration recalls early Pavement EPs, which were also full of funny noises played on instruments with made-up names, interrupted by actual songs. For another, it becomes more guitar-heavy on the back half. \u201cRushing the Acid Frat\u201d sounds like homemade Nuggets while the striking \u201cOcean of Revenge\u201d is a catchy, softly-rocking sketch in which a Scottish sharecropper gets hanged for axe-murdering a Mississippi plantation owner. \u201cLove the Door\u201d is best described by the man himself: \u201cKind of like a stereo ad, cocktail jazz thing, but with bad vibes and a weird time signature.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf you come for the textures, stay for the songs. The best might be the last, \u201cGrown Nothing,\u201d all chiming acoustics and gentle crooning over what sounds like programmed bossa nova drums. (Tucking a subtly gorgeous guitar ballad in at the end of your playful electronic album: very Malkmus.) Not everything on Groove Denied works, but it\u2019s gratifying to see a great songwriter still busy being born.", "pptitle": ["stephen", "malkmu", "groov", "deni", "album", "review", "roll", "stone"]}
