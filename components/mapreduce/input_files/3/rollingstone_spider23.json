It's a subdued yet arresting LP that blends sweet indie-pop with folk introspection and delicate piano balladry, as Jacklin offers up concise self-realizations without fuss or fanfare. \u201cI have your back,\u201d she offers early on, \u201cmore than I have mine.\u201d\r\nA breakup record of sorts, Crushing portrays the micro-stages that can follow a split: the endless night when it becomes clear things need to end (\u201cDon\u2019t Know How To Keep Loving You\u201d); the momentary crises in a breakup\u2019s immediate wake (\u201cWhen the Family Flies In\u201d); being forced to feel fun when you\u2019re not yet ready (\u201cPressure to Party\u201d). On the first of those songs, she expresses her emotional paralysis over a meditative riff that recalls Wilco and Courtney Barnett. \u201cI want your mother to stay friends with mine,\u201d is all she can muster.\r\nJacklin seems fascinated by corporeality and consciousness, the ways in which she can learn from and communicate with her own physicality. On \u201cBody,\u201d an overwhelming sensory experience leads to new emotional awareness: \u201cI felt the changing of the seasons,\u201d she sings, \u201call of my senses rushing back to me.\u201d By the very next song, the standout \"Head Alone,\" she's disputing Descartes\u2019 \u201cI think, therefore I am\u201d formulation, employing clever metaphor to center her bodily existence: \u201cGive me a full-length mirror/So I can see the whole picture,\u201d she pleads. \u201cMy head alone gives nothing away.\u201d\r\nWhen Jacklin isn\u2019t waxing philosophical on mind-body duality, she\u2019s simply showing the special way she processes the world around her. The result\u00a0is a profound statement that stands as an early candidate for this year\u2019s strongest singer-songwriter breakthrough.", "pptitle": ["review", "julia", "jacklin", "break", "crush", "roll", "stone"]}
