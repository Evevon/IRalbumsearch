But after releasing his debut album in 2014, he's waited five years before putting out a follow up.\r\nTurns out, that was a wise move. Wasteland, Baby! is relatively free of the too-high expectations that tend to plague young artist\u2019s anticipated second albums. In addition to the soul-searching title track, songs like \u201cNina Cried Power and \u201cShrike\u201d show new depth. The former, an ode to musical truth-telling with a fitting appearance from Mavis Staples is a welcome pop-protest left-turn that finds Hozier conjuring the power of his record collection as a means of symbolic resistance. The latter, a Celtic-lilted torch-song, features his sharpest lyricism to date: \"I couldn't utter my love when it counted,\" he sings, \"Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now.\"\r\nAnd yet, Hozier still spends much of the album burdened, in one form or another, by the success of \u201cTake Me To Church.\u201d That song\u2019s spectral presence can be found in moments like \u201cAlmost\u201d and \u201cTo Noise Making (Sing),\u201d songs that can feel like they\u2019re merely piling on feel-good folksy handclaps and grandiose gospel choirs in the hopes of landing on a chill-coffeehouse Spotify playlist.\r\nNevertheless, Wasteland, Baby! has enough encouraging displays of maturation to feel like a transitional moment for Hozier. At its best, the album carves out a space for the singer to work out his creative tensions as he finds new ways to make his straight folk influences more accessible without losing anything along the way.", "pptitle": ["review", "hozier", "deepen", "folksoul", "sound", "wasteland", "babi", "roll", "stone"]}
