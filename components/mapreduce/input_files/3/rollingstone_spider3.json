The child SoCal film star came out as a singer-songwriter adept in the \u201800s with Rilo Kiley, flirted with Omaha\u2019s indie scene for a hot minute, and ended up squarely where she started. You hear the sound of her LA hometurf singing loud through On The Line, her fourth solo set.\r\n\r\nSome of it\u2019s just backstory: her vocals tracked in Capitol Records Studio B, the room christened by Ol\u2019 Blue Eyes in 1956 when he gesticulated at the sessions for (Frank Sinatra Conducts) Tone Poems Of Color, her piano chords fingered on the same keys that voiced Carole King\u2019s Tapestry. The music indeed feels touched by King\u2019s white-girl Laurel Canyon soul, but maybe more by Harry Nilsson\u2019s tender, hooky wit. Lewis channels Brian Wilson\u2019s sun-kissed doo-wop on the title track \u2014 with a sly pun on letter-sweaters and a winking reference, perhaps, to \u201cCaroline No\u201d (here \u201cCaroline, uh\u201d). Elliott Smith gets namechecked on \u201cHeads Gonna Roll,\u201d the Go-Go's perky new wave shines from \u201cRabbit Hole,\u201d Fleetwood Mac\u2019s heady harmony-builds bloom on \u201cRed Bull and Hennessy.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd then there are the legends who actually play on the record. Jim Keltner has drummed behind Carly Simon, Lucinda Williams, Yoko Ono and every Beatle; he\u2019s on every track except the one Ringo Starr handles alone (they both play on \u201cRed Bull and Hennessy,\u201d as they did at the Concert For Bangladesh). Beck produces and sings on three songs. \u201cDo-Si-Do\u201d is a hazy, midtempo Odelay-scented space-rock chant on which Lewis manages to rhyme \u201cyou ain't no pharaoh\u201d with \u201cget back on your Paxil.\u201d And \u201cLittle White Dove\u201d is a playful lavender funk jam, very Prince via Midnite Vultures, that takes on more colors when you learn that it came out of Lewis\u2019 experience reconciling with her mom after years of estrangement, just before she died. The album also features a lot of production and guitar work by Ryan Adams, a fact that hasn\u2019t been boldfaced in the marketing bulletpoints. But even this reeks of Los Angeles, a town full of talented dirtbags and sun-baked human trainwrecks.\r\n\r\nAs glorious as the sound of this thing is, glinting with letter-perfect \u201870s-'80s rock sonics and touches of 21st-century psychedelic irony, the songs are the show, written by a woman of a particular age from a perspective well past jaded \u2014 she\u2019s been there done that \u2014 swung back around to a wide-eyed, faintly zen reportage. Poetic images pop. The little trip up north \u201cin a borrowed convertible red Porsche/ with a narcoleptic poet from Duluth\u201d that triggers existential reveries (\u201cHeads Gonna Roll\u201d). The druggy gal \u201csliding down a bong\u201d while nodding to Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cEverybody Knows\u201d and spinning cautionary tales to youngsters regarding Candy Crush (\u201cWasted Youth\u201d). The drifting Cali dreamer \u201con a Hollywood lawn today/ sucking back some Beaujolais/ remembering better days/ looking up at the chemtrail haze.\u201d (\u201cHollywood Lawn\u201d) The wild girl getting head in a Corvette and crying \u201clike Meryl Streep\u201d (\u201cParty Clown\u201d). The heartbroken girl on the Minnesota-Wisconsin border who, after discovering her lover\u2019s infidelity \u2013 \u201cI wanted to please you, my dress was see-through/\u2028As I looked through your phone\u201d -- contemplates an escape that might mirror the one in Bobby Gentry\u2019s \u201cOde To Billie Joe\u201d (\u201cTaffy\u201d).\r\n\r\nThe magic trick comes via Lewis\u2019 tone, ever so faintly wry, which lets her look into the camera while simultaneously playing the part, like Jean Seberg in Breathless. No moment epitomizes this more than her invoking the words \u201crock and roll\u201d on \u201cDo-Si-Do,\u201d wrapped in clouds of gossamer synthetics and reverb. It\u2019s a glorious and masterfully plastic delivery, so genuinely ecstatic the quotation marks around that sullied genre moniker take on their own beauty \u2014 the gild on a joyously self-aware hustle that\u2019s all the truer for it.", "pptitle": ["review", "la", "stori", "jenni", "lewi", "line", "roll", "stone"]}
