Sweetener was full of potential hits; the old-school model would have been to milk it for a couple of years, tour it to death, then start the cycle all over again. Instead, Grande went back in the studio while her energy was raging and banged out another album in two weeks. This is her Amnesiac to Sweetener\u2019s Kid A. The theme is basically, \u201cBreak up with your music industry, I\u2019m bored.\u201d\r\n\r\nSweetener was an ambitious artist crafting a self-consciously wide-scale pop statement. Thank U, Next is just a woman and a mood, taking that mood out for a drive until she pedal-to-the-metals it right off a cliff. What a glorious pop rush it is\u2014the album version of one of those emergency break-up karaoke sessions with a few therapeutic hours of Mary J. Blige and Toni Braxton songs.\r\n\r\n\u201cLately I\u2019ve been on a roller coaster/Trying to get hold of my emotions,\u201d Ariana confesses in \u201cNeedy.\u201d By \u201clately,\u201d she seems to mean since she first tasted oxygen, and by \u201cget hold of my emotions\u201d she means turning her emotions into a spectacular, larger-than-life mess. She\u2019s been through the ringer in the past two years\u2014the Manchester bombing, Mac Miller\u2019s death, a whirlwind engagement that turned into a messy public split. Thank U, Next is her response, reflecting her new determination to move fast and keep it spontaneous. \u201cMy dream has always been to be\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does,\u201d she told Billboard in December. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, \u2018Bruh, I just want to fucking talk to my fans and sing and write music and drop it the way these boys do.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen she surprised the world with \u201cThank U, Next\u201d last fall, no one was expecting more than a quickie celebrity-shade novelty, yet it turned out to be a ballad with astonishing grace and resonance\u2014and the whole album is up to that level. She\u2019s going for the off-the-dome energy of a hip-hop mixtape: no guest stars, no duets. She works with her most trusted collaborators, like Max Martin, Tommy Brown, Victoria Monet, Tayla Parx and Pop Wansel. As she sings in \u201cGhostin\u2019,\u201d her surprisingly candid ballad about death, grief and recovery, \u201cI\u2019m a girl with a whole lot of baggage.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s strange to go back and listen to \u201cDangerous Woman\u201d from just three years ago, back when Ariana sang about needing a dude to make her feel dangerous. Picture that. Well, those days are gone\u2014this Ariana needs danger lessons like she needs an extra ponytail. Like she sings in the excellent \u201cMakeup,\u201d \u201cLet me stay in my bag, \u2018cause I like when you mad/It\u2019s a mood, it\u2019s a vibe, it\u2019s a look, it\u2019s a match.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c7 Rings\u201d bites The Sound of Music, but it\u2019s much cooler than that time Gwen Stefani did \u201cThe Lonely Goatherd\u201d\u2014Ari fuses trap and Maria Von Trapp, from the Alps to the ATL. Yet it\u2019s not really a song about expensive jewelry and bubbly. At heart, it\u2019s a song about treating yourself and your friends like superstars even if nobody else notices. It\u2019s her version of Cher's \u201cBut mom, I am a rich man\u201d speech. \u201cNASA\u201d is her excellent space-oddity ballad about her emotional solar system and the way her orbit changes over time; \u201cFake Smile\u201d samples the Wendy Rene dusty soul groove \u201cAfter Laughter,\u201d a hip-hop touchstone via the Wu-Tang Clan.\r\n\r\n\u201cBreak Up With Your Girlfriend, I\u2019m Bored\u201d is a perfect song title in the tradition of Britney\u2019s \u201cGet Naked (I Got a Plan),\u201d with Max Martin and a clever interpolation of the 'NSync deep cut \u201cIt Makes Me Ill.\u201d It\u2019s the perfect way to end this album\u2014after crying her tears and screaming her screams and feeling her feels, Ari flirts with the bartender on her way out, ready for more punishment. This is one of the year\u2019s best pop albums so far, even in a 2019 that\u2019s already turning out to be a great one for new music. Thank U, Next makes you suspect that the best Ariana is yet to come.", "pptitle": ["review", "ariana", "grand", "move", "spectacular", "style", "thank", "u", "roll", "stone"]}
