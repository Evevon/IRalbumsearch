But give the Brooklyn hip-hop troll credit: he\u2019s critic-proof. Even as he languishes in a New York detention center on federal charges due to his alleged association with the Nine Trey Gangsters, his second project, Dummy Boy, opened at number two on the Billboard charts.\r\n\r\n6ix9ine\u2019s modus operandi \u2014 hoarse and shouting, with vague but insistent references to Bloods mayhem and streetwise depravity \u2014 clearly resonates with a wide audience (though in the streaming era, it\u2019s impossible to distinguish between genuine fandom and the kind of hate-listening rap fans use to devour hours of new content). His blend of garish Day-Glo net art and brawling homage to the glory years of DMX and Onyx may be a commercially effective millennial update of Rotten Apple thug rap. But aesthetically, his distinct lack of lyrical talent and annoyingly hyperactive presence often undermines the whole thing.\r\n\r\nDummy Boy tries to broaden 6ix9ine\u2019s scope beyond his February mixtape debut, Day 69: Graduation Day, and bloody flag-waving singles like \u201cGummo.\u201d The big radio hit here, the softly thumping \u201cFefe,\u201d finds him muting his voice into an Auto-Tune murmur, growling, \u201cI don\u2019t really want no friends.\u201d But it has all the personality of a wet blanket and is more notable for being a public relations disaster for his collaborator, Nicki Minaj. Much as the music industry tries to pretend otherwise, many people are still upset that a man who pled guilty to filming an underage girl in a sexual performance for his Instagram account is allowed to thrive on radio stations around the country.\r\n\r\nBut even listeners who blithely tune out 6ix9ine\u2019s extra-musical controversies may find Dummy Boy rough-going. The opening cut promises a cameo from Bobby Shmurda \u2013 another New York rapper who briefly scaled the rap charts before his imprisonment on alleged gang affiliations \u2013 and 6ix9ine tries to spark drama by calling Ebro \u201can old nigga on a young nigga dick.\u201d But Shmurda\u2019s hissy, literally phoned-in verse disrupts any rah-rah energy 6ix9ine generates. In fact, most of the album finds 6ix9ine ceding the spotlight to a list of guests, including Lil Baby (\u201cTic Toc\u201d), A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie (\u201cWaka\u201d), Gunna (\u201cFeefa\u201d) and others. Only Kanye West, of all people, seems content to complement the headliner\u2019s wack-ass lines like \u201cI\u2019m a muthafuckin\u2019 sex addict/Hit shorty from the back, gotta back-crack it\u201d on \u201cKanga.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhich leads to the question: Why is this second-rate ham so popular? 6ix9ine\u2019s adrenalized voice might sound as intoxicating as a ride in a bumper car, but at least it provides energy to a mainstream scene too dazzled by narcoleptic, opiate-dazed rap singers. \u201cLast year I was sleeping in the basement\u2026I was coming off the bench, I wasn\u2019t starting/Now I\u2019m out here ballin\u2019 like I\u2019m Harden,\u201d he sings on \u201cDummy,\u201d perhaps the album\u2019s best track. If only he spent time working on his craft and writing decent songs instead of trying to be a villain for the social-media age. Now, as he faces life in prison, it might be too late.", "pptitle": ["tekashi", "6ix9in", "dummi", "boy", "album", "review", "roll", "stone"]}
