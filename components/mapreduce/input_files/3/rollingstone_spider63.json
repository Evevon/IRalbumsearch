The song is ghosted by headlines of failed gun-safety legislation, dubious police shootings and senseless military pursuits, and it\u2019s an object lesson in how to engage a national crisis without histrionics or mincing words.\r\nThis shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise: Cash is one of the most ambitious and literary songwriters of her generation \u2014 along with her back catalog of LPs (start with 1990\u2019s\u00a0Interiors), see the story collection Bodies of Water and her memoir,\u00a0Composed. But she goes especially deep on this set. Sometimes the songs appear to conjure autobiography, like \u201cEveryone But Me,\u201d which involves the loss of a mother and father. Other times she puts more distance between self and subject. The title track, co-written with kindred spirit Sam Phillips, is a meditation that shifts perspective between first and third person with echoes of the\u00a0Kavanaugh hearings and #MeToo \u2014 \u201cVersions of the third degree,\u201d Cash sings over a blues processional, \u201cyours and hers and mine.\u201d\r\nAll humans have father issues, and as the daughter of Johnny, Rosanne Cash\u2019s are particular to life in a country music dynasty (she\u2019s also step-daughter of June Carter and ex-wife of Rodney Crowell). But they don\u2019t define her art, however much they inform it. She remains hard to categorize, refracting country alongside rock, folk and other elements befitting a longtime resident of New York City\u2019s melting pot. And her most beautiful work can lean into the abstract.\u00a0\u201cParticle and Wave\u201d is an extended metaphor involving physics, suffering and time.\r\nThe album\u2019s dark lodestar is \u201cThis Is My Least Favorite Life,\u201d a sweetly grim waltz with an Eastern European lilt, Brechtian existentialism and a little Tom Waits-ian surrealism. \u201cThe station pulls away from the train/ the blue pulls away from the sky,\u201d she sings, conjuring an emotional dislocation that may feel familiar right about now. But in her narrative hands, it\u2019s comforting not to be traveling alone.", "pptitle": ["review", "rosann", "cash", "rememb", "roll", "stone"]}
