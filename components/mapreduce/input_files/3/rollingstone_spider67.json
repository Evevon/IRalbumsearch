(Just to add to the vibe, the \u201cHere\u201d sample was a staple for trip-hop cranks like Portishead and Tricky before Cara was born.) \u201cHere\u201d was the surprise smash that set the Toronto teen on the fast track to a Grammy for Best New Artist. On her excellent second album, The Pains of Growing, Cara really comes of age as a major voice of young-adult disenchantment. As she asks in \u201cEasier Said,\u201d \u201cSo what if you\u2019re a bit bitter before you recharge?/I mean, I spend my days complaining to a guitar.\u201d And Cara never comes close to running out of eloquent complaints.\r\n\r\nStill only 22, Cara has grown way beyond \u201cHere\u201d \u2014 but she still sounds loaded with confidence, brashness and a salt mine\u2019s worth of party-killer attitude. Her soulful voice has matured, with a touch of Billie Holiday in her upper register. Well-titled statements like \u201cI Don\u2019t Want To\u201d and \u201cNot Today\u201d set the tone for the whole album \u2014 Cara sings her post-adolescent blues (\u201cOne day I swear the pain will be a blip.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. I\u2019ll be the king of misery management\u201d) over stripped-down guitar. Cara had a uniquely strong hand in creating\u00a0The Pains of Growing\u00a0\u2014 she wrote or co-wrote every track on it and produced three of them herself.\r\n\r\nShe seizes the role of pop auteur, venting with a jaded wit that feels totally fresh. This girl is not here for anyone\u2019s nonsense, and she\u2019s not shy about letting you know. She\u2019s got shade for the fashion world (\u201cI rock my soul on both sleeves of my T-shirt\u201d), her phone (\u201cthe anti-social media perpetuates the mess\u201d), the menfolk (\u201cHey, Mr. Knock on My Door/I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019ve been emotions galore\u201d). She even gets away with that time-honored staple of second albums, the road song about how soul-crushing it is to be trapped in hotel rooms. Except when Cara does it in \u201cWherever I Live,\u201d she\u2019s full of clever and original touches, with lines like, \u201cI hear the laughter from the TV/Static Rachel talks to Phoebe.\u201d\r\n\r\nCara re-teams with Pop and Oak, the production duo behind \u201cHere,\u201d on five tracks, including the single \u201cTrust My Lonely,\u201d where she gives herself a new-rules pep talk over a sliced-and-diced reggae skank. \u201cComfortable\u201d is a trad Motown-style ballad with No I.D., and \u201c7 Days\u201d is a stern talking-to for \u201cMr. Man Upstairs,\u201d picturing him as he watches the end-times on Earth: \u201cCurled up on his couch right now/As we fail to figure it out/Does he turn down the sound?\u201d\r\n\r\nCara sees herself as the outsider, the girl on the margins who never fits in. As she shrugs toward the end of the album, \u201cMy kind of fun doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d But all over\u00a0The Pains of Growing,\u00a0she\u2019s got a style that\u2019s all her own.", "pptitle": ["alessia", "cara", "pain", "grow", "album", "review", "roll", "stone"]}
