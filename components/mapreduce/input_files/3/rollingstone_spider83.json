Now they\u2019ve finally released Thought Gang, a project that has only previously surfaced on Lynch\u2019s soundtrack to\u00a0Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me\u00a0and in the backgrounds of his works like\u00a0Mulholland Drive\u00a0and\u00a0Inland Empire. A far cry from the hipster, cool\u00a0jazz\u00a0of\u00a0Twin Peaks\u00a0or the dreamy pop of their work with singer Julee Cruise, the record is a schizophrenic, free-jazz experiment in which Badalamenti played with a couple of jazz ensembles that tried to put Lynch\u2019s fantastical scenes to music; the director would either give them a scenario to interpret (such as people driving to the desert where they witness aliens) for an instrumental or they\u2019d complement his beat poetry, like \u201cA Real Indication\u201d or \u201cWoodcutters From Fiery Ships,\u201d which are both about deranged people in strange circumstances (like his films). It\u2019s unpredictable and uneven but also strangely compelling and overwhelmingly Lynchian. It\u2019s a whole new side to these two that you didn\u2019t know you wanted.", "pptitle": ["review", "david", "lynch", "angelo", "badalamenti", "thought", "gang", "roll", "stone"]}
