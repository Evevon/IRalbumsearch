Yet Miller can also be a surly man of his times: \u201cPermanent Damage\u201d is a fuck-you to a tedious storyteller that declares\u00a0\u201cNobody wants to hear about your stupid dream,\u201d and sneeringly rhymes \u201csuper deep\u201d with \u201cgo back to sleep.\u201d\r\nLike his prior solo LPs (The Instigator, The Dreamer, The Believer, The Traveler),\u00a0The Messenger\u00a0highlights Miller\u2019s writing uncoupled from the speeding locomotive of the \u201897s, and the vibe this time is especially reflective. \u201cI Used To Write In Notebooks\u201d is a Beatle-esque chronicle of time\u2019s passage via technology and personal psychology; in similar spirit, \u201cClose Most of The Time\u201d dissects life from age 17 to 29 via cars (including a white \u201969 Ranchero that \u201calmost ran\u201d) and similarly dysfunctional relationships. It\u2019s the unsparing sound of a dude of a certain age looking in the mirror, and the fact the album is framed by first person mea-culpas titled \u201cTotal Disaster\u201d and \u201cBroken,\u201d respectively, tells you all you need to know about what said dude sees. To his credit, he owns every bit of it, and as confessionals, they\u2019re so hooky and well-calibrated, they feel like absolutions even when they don\u2019t sell themselves as such. One imagines it\u2019s been informed by years of therapy. If so, the shrinks certainly earned their fees, and Miller\u2019s songwriting\u2019s the richer for it.", "pptitle": ["review", "rhett", "miller", "deliv", "hooki", "plainspoken", "confession", "messeng", "roll", "stone"]}
