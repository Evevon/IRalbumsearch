The album was Ray Davies\u2019 spry, personal love letter to postwar Britain at a time when old shops were being bulldozed in favor of ugly new buildings and people were switching from wooden kegs to metal ones for their draught beer. Songs like the existentially angsty \u201cAnimal Farm,\u201d the wistful \u201cDo You Remember Walter?\u201d and the quirky \u201cPeople Take Pictures of Each Other\u201d are among the best Davies ever wrote. Although a lot of this material has come out over the years in various forms, the remastering sounds crisp and it\u2019s great to have the album\u2019s songs next to singles like \u201cDays\u201d and \u201cWonderboy,\u201d as well as the upbeat radio recordings the band made. The physical box set adds all sorts of goodies, including a book with a tribute from the Who\u2019s Pete Townshend in it. It\u2019s an act of preservation worthy of the Kinks.", "pptitle": ["review", "kink", "villag", "green", "preserv", "societi", "super", "delux", "edit", "roll", "stone"]}
