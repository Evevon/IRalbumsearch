Since then the MC\u2019s star has ascended, scoring a British No 1 last year with Dave on the triumphant, billowing Funky Friday.\nNow on his debut album, Fredo delivers grit, authenticity and vitality over bangers, hollowed-out beats and dazzling keys. The lyrics are searingly honest and assured \u2013 whether he\u2019s talking angrily about so-called friends who didn\u2019t visit him in jail, expressing a sweet gratitude to his mother for dealing with him being \u201ca bad kid\u201d, or rolling his eyes about a schoolteacher who used to give him grief. Third Avenue finds an artist at ease with himself, and at ease with addressing his demons. The genre-melding production is perhaps more old school than his peers, and at times can feel a little clunky \u2013 but ultimately it adds to a sense that Fredo\u2019s not here to hop on a trend. This is an accomplished full-length that, while not a game-changer, certainly slots neatly into the burgeoning UK canon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nWatch the video for All I Ever Wanted ft Dave.\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nRap\n\n\n\n\nThe Observer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["fredo", "avenu", "review", "honest", "gritti", "debut", "album", "music", "guardian"]}
