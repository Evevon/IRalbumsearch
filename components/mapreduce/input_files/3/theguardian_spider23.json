A study of 20th-century music, published in 1961, had made enormous claims for his significance, suggesting he would become the greatest composer of the second half of the 20th century, but neither during his lifetime, nor in the almost half a century since, have those claims been reflected in performances of his music, which are rare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Jean Barraqu\u00e9: Works for Piano album artwork\n\n\nBarraqu\u00e9 seems destined to remain one of the most mysterious figures in that generation of radical composers, led by Pierre Boulez, who attended Messiaen\u2019s classes at the Paris Conservatoire in the years after the second world war.\nThe Barraqu\u00e9 work that does receive occasional performances is his massive Piano Sonata, composed between 1950 and 1952, but which was not performed in public until 1967. Jean-Pierre Collot\u2019s recording is at least the seventh version of this hugely challenging piece to make it on to disc, and despite its shortcomings, it does provide a vivid reminder of what an extraordinary work the sonata is, one of the great achievements of total serialism.\nClearly indebted to Boulez\u2019s Second Sonata, composed two years before it, it\u2019s just as potently modelled on Beethoven\u2019s Hammerklavier, so that its epic sense of struggle between fast and slow, notes and silence, engages the listener rather than keeping them at a distance.\nThough Collot\u2019s performance leaves something to be desired \u2013 for all its fluency, it sometimes seems far too fast and slick (it is more than 15 minutes quicker than the version included in the 1998 CPO set of Barraqu\u00e9\u2019s complete works, and eight minutes faster than Herbert Henck\u2019s superb account on ECM) \u2013 he does play some of the piano pieces that Barraqu\u00e9 composed before the sonata, in the late 1940s, which were suppressed in his lifetime. They show him gradually adapting serial language to his own fiercely personal expressive ends, and so colour in just a few more details of the emergence of this profoundly elusive composer.\nAlso out this week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  Clarity and brilliance \u2026 Tamara Stefanovich. Photograph: Olja Radmanovich\n\n\nCant\u00e9yodjay\u00e2, the stand-alone piano piece that Messiaen composed during the period in which Barraqu\u00e9 was attending his classes, is one of the highlights on Tamara Stefanovich\u2019s new recital disc for Pentatone. Her sequence begins with Ives\u2019s Piano Sonata No 1 (far less well known than his second, the Concord Sonata, but just as uncompromising), and goes on to Bart\u00f3k\u2019s acerbic Improvisations on Hungarian Peasant Songs and the Messiaen, before finally finding some repose in a gem-like account of JS Bach\u2019s rarely heard Aria Variata alla Maniera Italiana. It\u2019s an exciting, challenging collection, delivered with fabulous clarity and brilliance.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nClassical music\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["barraq", "work", "piano", "review", "elus", "serialist", "get", "rare", "outing", "andrew", "clement", "classic", "cd", "week", "music", "guardian"]}
