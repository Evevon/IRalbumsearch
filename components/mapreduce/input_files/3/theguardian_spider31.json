Indeed, Frank Black aside, it\u2019s hard to think of a solo canon that\u2019s been quite so consistently underwhelming.\nWhich makes this long-delayed adventure in electronica such a surprise. In fact, it\u2019s such a radical departure that his record label initially refused to release it \u2013 hence the title. Largely written in Berlin and recorded alone at home in Oregon, its stark and forbidding soundscapes owe much to the early-80s synth movement, the likes of opener Belziger Faceplant far more concerned with texture than melody; the deadpan A Bit Wilder, meanwhile, could be a mechanically recovered New Order offcut, circa 1981. Curiously, this bold new direction isn\u2019t sustained; the further into the album Malkmus gets, the more normal service resumes, as if he isn\u2019t entirely convinced of his new direction. Forget Your Place\u2019s loops and treated vocals recall the Beta Band at their wooziest; Come Get Me sounds like a flab-free demo version of one of his Jicks songs; Ocean of Revenge, for all its flirtation with drum machines, is an unashamedly lovely acoustic ballad. It doesn\u2019t make for a particularly cohesive album, but perhaps that\u2019s the point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\nWatch the video for Come Get Me by Stephen Malkmus.\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nStephen Malkmus\n\n\n\n\nThe Observer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectronic music\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["stephen", "malkmu", "groov", "deni", "review", "stark", "forbid", "soundscap", "music", "guardian"]}
