The musical moniker of Buckinghamshire-born Amber Bain (the name inspired by a childhood holiday home once owned by Kate Winslet) was part of a concerted attempt to use generalities as opposed to specifics. That also meant there were no press pictures to accompany her early EPs of skittering electronic hymnals, while her voice was often buried beneath ghostly, often androgynous effects. On Good at Falling, her debut album, the walls come tumbling down, with Bain picking at the scabs of a broken relationship with the sort of direct candour that would have seemed unimaginable when she arrived in 2015.\nFuelled by this emotional blood-letting, plus extensive touring with label-mates Wolf Alice and the 1975 (the latter\u2019s George Daniel also co-produced the album), Good at Falling also sees Bain opening up her sound. While those early EPs seemed almost hermetically sealed, here Bain lets some air in. She skips unadorned around the lovely acoustic strums of You Seemed So Happy, and channels 70s MOR on the yearning Faraway, while the stately pop of Lilo \u2013 so specifically about the dissolution of her relationship with fellow singer-songwriter Marika Hackman that their breakup is re-created in the accompanying video \u2013 feels like a refreshing splash of cold water on tear-stained cheeks. Even when the lyrics are mired in sadness \u2013 \u201cI think I\u2019m dying, because this can\u2019t be living\u201d Bain sighs, on the Chvrches-esque Maybe You\u2019re the Reason \u2013 there\u2019s a laser-guided focus that keeps things from imploding.\nOf course, wallowing in someone else\u2019s misery for too long can grate, and there are moments, as on the shape-shifting Everybody Hates Me, where the bare-faced sadness of the lyrics doesn\u2019t quite coalesce into actual emotions. There\u2019s also a slipperiness to the production that means you never quite know where you are. Voices shift, melodies disintegrate and those vocal filters sometimes keep you at arm\u2019s length. For the most part, however, Bain showcases a keen self-awareness, perfectly communicating We Talk All the Time\u2019s relatable sense of denial in just one line: \u201cWe don\u2019t fuck any more, but we talk all the time, so it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop and rock\n\n\n\n\nElectronic music\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["japanes", "hous", "good", "fall", "review", "candid", "breakup", "pop", "let", "air", "music", "guardian"]}
