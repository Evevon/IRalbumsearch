The Scottish artist loved traditional songs (2009\u2019s Folk Songs completed a project inspired by his love of Anne Briggs), and he played with folk-associated musicians (Norma and Mike Waterson on record; John Martyn on tour). But different colours and textures kept flaming and blistering in his music, culminating in his brilliant Yorkston/Thorne/Khan albums of recent years. Stirring together folk, Indian raga and jazz into deliciously exploratory but strangely familiar music, they revealed Yorkston as a musician who never forsakes intimacy for inventiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  Facebook \n \n\n\n  Twitter \n \n\n\n  Pinterest \n\n\n\n\n\n  James Yorkston: The Route to the Harmonium album artwork\n\n\nYorkston\u2019s first solo record in five years was made at his ramshackle loft studio in Cellardyke, East Fife. Fisherman\u2019s nets were once mended there; now traditional instruments fill it, such as the concertina, the Swedish nyckelharpa, and the instrument of the album\u2019s title. Together with Tom Arthurs\u2019s trumpet (bringing to mind Talk Talk), they afford a delicate authority to songs which explore big subjects in breathlessly whispered ways: ageing, parenthood, responsibility, nationality, fraying love, regret, and death. This is music to get lost in, for headphones, and for your head.Yorkston\u2019s talents as a writer drive these songs (he has also released a memoir and a novel in recent years). Phrases leap out, some delicate, some devastating: \u201ctight, damp pilgrims\u201d; friends who return to bad behaviours \u201clike bees to foxglove\u201d; \u201cI may stand here full of heart / But I have no space for your hurt.\u201d He revisits older work, too, such as 2005 instrumental Yorkston Athletic, now with added lyrics, while My Mouth Ain\u2019t No Bible becomes a spoken-word epic, about a man dying, another living \u2013 the universe and everything, no less. \u201cI could have been a lifer \u2013 a Martin Carthy, a Michael Hurley, a Michael Chapman, a Peter Br\u00f6tzmann,\u201d Yorkston raves towards its end, folk and free jazz heroes tumbling from his lips. There\u2019s no \u201ccould have\u201d: he just is.\n\n\n\nAlso out this month\nLleuwen\u2019s Gwn Gl\u00e2n Beibl Budr/Clean Gun Dirty Bible is a fascinating, experimental exploration of Welsh folk songs and hymns from the Brittany-based singer, delivered with blood and bite worthy of PJ Harvey. Ye Vagabonds\u2019 debut, The Hare\u2019s Lament, is a beautifully straight, heartfelt collection of traditional songs from Dublin, Donegal, and beyond, from brothers Br\u00edan and Diarmuid Mac Gloinn. Alex Rex\u2019s Otterburn sees extraordinary folk drummer Alex Neilson push his solo singer-songwriter work even further, with an album stimulated and suffused by the sudden death of his younger brother.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nFolk music\n\n\n\n\nFolk album of the month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["jame", "yorkston", "rout", "harmonium", "review", "intim", "marvel", "jude", "rogerss", "folk", "cd", "month", "music", "guardian"]}
