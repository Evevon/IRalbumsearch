The latter\u2019s seminal album Merriweather Post Pavilion turns 10 this year and was an epic feat of indie experimentalism that hasn\u2019t, wrote Pitchfork recently, been surpassed.\nNo doubt that anniversary was at the back of Lennox\u2019s mind when he made Buoys. His sixth solo album is remarkably more muted than his previous work. Lead single Token and its Lemon Jelly-like sampledelia throws back to Merriweather, a spiritual successor to the joyful rush of My Girls, but otherwise Buoys offers a sort of deconstructed R&B that focuses on repetition and restraint.\nIn places it\u2019s undeniably clever, the playful production peacockery \u2013 with Rusty Santos, who worked on Person Pitch, Panda Bear\u2019s precursor to Merriweather \u2013 suggesting futuristic electronic auteurs Sophie or Oneohtrix Point Never. I Know I Don\u2019t Know, for example, is like watching a deranged western with holes in the celluloid; the quasi-Balearic tune Dolphin pleasingly turns a splish-splosh of water into the beat and courts continued comparisons to the Beach Boys.\n\n\n\nBut unless you find Panda Bear\u2019s quirks endlessly endearing, such innovations can sound irksome. The propulsive strumming, which spurts through many of the tracks, is defiantly monotonous. Lennox\u2019s coo has never sounded better than on Master but its unrelentingly dull pace tugs it down. And then there is Inner Monologue, a breathy woman\u2019s orgasm noise as Lennox intones \u201cone to one\u201d over and over, until we get the point.\nBuoys is anchored by form but ultimately that is what holds it back.
