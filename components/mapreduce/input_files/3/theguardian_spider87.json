In July 1992, jazz composer Mike Westbrook, with 24 musicians, plus crew and guests, flew to Catania, Sicily, for a three-evening festival of Westbrook\u2019s music. It took place in the open air, in the heart of the city, and admission was free.\nThe music on this double CD has been garnered from surviving tapes and cassettes made at the time, although the quality is remarkably good. Most of it comes from the evening devoted to what Westbrook called his European Song Book, including settings of poems by Lorca and Blake, and arrangements of songs by Brecht and Weill. There\u2019s also a bravura treatment of It Don\u2019t Mean a Thing, with phenomenal soprano saxophone from Peter Whyman. In fact, this was a cracking good band altogether, combining old Westbrook hands such as Whyman and fellow saxophonist Chris Biscoe with brilliant newcomers like Alan Barnes (alto saxophone and clarinet) and vibraphonist Anthony Kerr. Recalling the event, Westbrook writes that the Catania festival was \u201cthe best gift a composer ever had\u201d.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nJazz\n\n\n\n\nThe Observer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalbum reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n", "pptitle": ["mike", "westbrook", "orchestra", "catania", "review", "enchant", "even", "music", "guardian"]}
