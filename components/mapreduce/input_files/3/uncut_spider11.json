I\u2019m very glad that I\u2019m able to be here 50 years later celebrating it. I hope to have a great time. I\u2019m going to be playing most of the same songs that I played then. I\u2019ve had a few more songs since then. But I think culturally, for me, it resonates because it was such a watershed moment in the time of my generation.\u201dYou can find out more details about Woodstock 50 at the festival\u2019s official site.
