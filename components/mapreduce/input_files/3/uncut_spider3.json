Usually, \u2028I am only concerned with right now and what\u2019s happening tomorrow. The past for me is done. But this record does look back a little more than I\u2019m used to doing.\u201dOrder the latest issue of Uncut online and have it sent to your home!It was while walking on nearby Brora beach in 1977 that Collins had a vision for the jangly, witty yet subversive music he wanted to make. After what he calls a \u201cterrible apprenticeship\u201d with his first bands, Onyx and then Nu-Sonics, he went back to Glasgow and formulated Orange Juice with self-styled music svengali Alan Horne.\u201cI still remember that walk on the beach,\u201d smiles Collins. \u201cIt felt like a real \u2018now or never\u2019 moment.\u201d Orange Juice disbanded in 1985. But not before Collins had \u2028made a reputation for himself by goading and challenging his frustrated paymasters. \u201cYou had to show these bastards you meant it,\u201d he says.\u201cYou form a band in a creative bubble and you have your own ideas of integrity. Then suddenly you\u2019re on Top Of The Pops and you confront the machine. They wanted us to perform with dancers, doing a ripping up paper dance [along to \u201cRip It Up\u201d]. We said no. They insisted. Drugs and alcohol were involved in our backstage preparations and, unfortunately, once our performance started, David McClymont fell off the stage. That caused us a lot of problems afterwards. It was deemed unprofessional by the BBC and by our paymasters at the record company. \u201cThe Head of International at Polydor told me: \u2018The bottom line, Edwyn, is if you don\u2019t play the game you\u2019re not going to have a career.\u2019 I leant over the table and said, \u2018Don\u2019t you fucking bottom line me, mate.\u2019 I used to attend meetings carrying a brolly and attach\u00e9 case and I\u2019d enter the building and say to reception staff, \u2018Good morning, ladies. What have you been doing to advance the prospects of my group Orange Juice this fine day?\u2019 \u2028I was arrogant as fuck. Some people at the record company found it funny, but most didn\u2019t. Most of them were macho, stupid people and they needed the piss taken out of them.\u201dCollins suffered two strokes in 2005 and had to learn to speak, read and walk again. Was he daunted? \u201cThere were frustrations. I felt like a moron for six months \u2013 all I could say was four things: \u2018Yes\u2019, \u2018No\u2019, \u2018Grace Maxwell\u2019 and \u2018The possibilities \u2028are endless\u2019. But to be honest, I felt lucky to still be here\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t change anything. Never harbour regrets. You have to come near to your own end to truly value life.\u201dYou can read much more from Edwyn Collins in the current issue of Uncut, out now with John Lennon on the cover.Subscribe to Uncut and make huge savings on the cover price \u2013 find out by clicking here!
