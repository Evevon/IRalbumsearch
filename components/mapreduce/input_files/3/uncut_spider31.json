I am an avid reader and have really enjoyed writing it. I am also happy to say the majority of the music is composed, ready to be polished up for release and performance. It\u2019s tremendously exciting.\u201dOrder the latest issue of Uncut online and have it sent to your home!Publisher Mark Booth adds: \u201cThe Age of Anxiety is a great rock novel, but that is one of the less important things about it. The narrator is a brilliant creation \u2013 cultured, witty and unreliable. The novel captures the craziness of the music business and displays Pete Townshend\u2019s sly sense of humour and sharp ear for dialogue. First conceived as an opera, The Age of Anxiety deals with mythic and operatic themes including a maze, divine madness and long-lost children. Hallucinations and soundscapes haunt this novel, which on one level is an extended meditation on manic genius and the dark art of creativity\u201d.Details about the accompanying opera, album and art installation will follow in due course.Subscribe to Uncut and make huge savings on the cover price \u2013 find out by clicking here!
