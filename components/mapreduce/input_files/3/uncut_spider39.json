Now it\u2019s about reverse-engineering it.\u201d SUBSCRIBE TO UNCUT AND SAVE 50% \u2013 HERE\u2019S HOW!While This (Is What I Wanted To Tell You) may seem radically different from \u2028the band\u2019s earliest releases, it still plays like a Lambchop record. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable how it sounds simultaneously them and not them,\u201d says Ira Kaplan of Yo La Tengo. \u201cIt\u2019s the same impression \u2028I had of them when I first heard them. They\u2019ve changed a lot over the years, but what struck me that first time was how so many people could play so quietly together. Lambchop create a cacophony, but it\u2019s such a sweet cacophony.\u201dWagner has settled gracefully, even beatifically into his day job as an artist, and he chuckles when he describes himself as \u201cyour typical house husband. \u2028I try to do what I can during normal working hours, but I try to clock out at five. Cook dinner for my wife. Do some housework. I love my life the way it is, but I\u2019m always trying to find ways to make these things coexist. That\u2019s been my goal from the beginning: to just be a normal dude and do this without being seduced by things that make me a not-better person.\u201dWhat Wagner doesn\u2019t want is to become the indie-rock curmudgeon, grumbling about the good old days while shouting at the kids to get off his lawn. Rather, he finds inspiration and something like reassurance in the new generation of musicians moving to Nashville. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine trying to start out in this environment, but people do it everyday. It\u2019s exciting to see them do it. But I can\u2019t imagine being young right now. To live in Nashville and be starting out \u2013 they\u2019re working three jobs and playing music, and it\u2019s incredible to me.\u201dRecently, Wagner and his wife, along with a few friends, invested \u2028in a club downtown, which they\u2019re turning into an all-ages venue. \u201cI\u2019m just one of the landlords,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll get me out of the house more. Who\u2019s that weird old dude in the back of the club? That\u2019ll be me.\u201d In other words, he knows he can be involved but only at a remove that allows a younger generation to devise their own scene, to play their own shows, to form their own bands. \u201cI\u2019m completely realistic about it. I don\u2019t take for granted that there will be a tomorrow as far as what I do. I\u2019ll always make stuff, whether or not anybody will hear it or not, but \u2028I don\u2019t know if it will be a way of sustaining myself.\u201dWhen he\u2019s not at the club, he\u2019ll be at home, dreaming up the next Lambchop album and the next one after that. \u201cThis is hopefully where I end up, this old guy in an office putting out a record every now and then. I\u2019m just too old to do anything else. Maybe there will be a genre someday called Old Fucks Who Keep Doing Their Thing. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a roadmap for us elder statesmen, so I guess I\u2019m just going to create my own map that allows me to do the things I love and avoid the things I don\u2019t.\u201dYou can read much more about Lambchop in the current issue of Uncut, in shops now with Leonard Cohen on the cover.Subscribe to Uncut and make huge savings on the cover price \u2013 find out by clicking here!
