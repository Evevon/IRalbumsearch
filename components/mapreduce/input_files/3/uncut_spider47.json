It\u2019s making its debut on vinyl and predates the 2nd February Morgan Studios recording that featured in the unbroadcast Love You Till Tuesday television film.\nSide B\n\u201cLover To The Dawn\u201d\nThis song aimed at a former lover would eventually morph into \u201cCygnet Committee\u201d recorded for the David Bowie (aka Space Oddity) album later in the year.Single 2\nSide A\n\u201cChing-a-Ling\u201d\nPreviously recorded in October 1968 by the trio Turquoise featuring David, Hermione and Tony Hill (who became Feathers when Hutch replaced Hill). David and Hutch continued to perform the song as a duo following Hermione\u2019s departure.\nSide B\n\u201cAn Occasional Dream\u201d\nSlightly different lyrically to the later album version, this version of the demo also first appeared on the deleted Space Oddity 40th Anniversary release.\n\nSingle 3\nSide A\n\u201cLet Me Sleep Beside You\u201d\nA studio version was first recorded in September 1967 but remained unreleased until The World Of David Bowie album in 1970.
