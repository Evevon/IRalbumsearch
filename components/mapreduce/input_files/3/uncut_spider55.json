All sale proceeds will benefit charitable causes. Says Gilmour: \u201cThese guitars have been very good to me and many of them have gifted me pieces of music over the years. They have paid for themselves many times over, but it\u2019s now time that they moved on. Guitars were made to be played and it is my wish that wherever they end up, they continue to give their owners the gift of music. By auctioning these guitars I hope that I can give some help where it is really needed and through my charitable foundation do some good in this world. It will be a wrench to see them go and perhaps one day I\u2019ll have to track one or two of them down and buy them back!\u201dThe collection will be on show at Christie\u2019s in London from March 27-31, with the auction taking place in New York on June 20.Subscribe to Uncut and make huge savings on the cover price \u2013 find out by clicking here!Like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter to keep up to date with the latest news from Uncut.The March 2019 issue of Uncut is now on sale in the UK \u2013 with Leonard Cohen on the cover.
