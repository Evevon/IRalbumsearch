No cause of death has been revealed as yet, but Dale had been battling a number of health problems in recent years, claiming in 2015 that he was forced to keep touring in order to fund his medical costs. He had a number of tour dates lined up for the rest of 2019.Order the latest issue of Uncut online and have it sent to your home!Dick Dale shot to fame in the early \u201960s with hits such as \u201cLet\u2019s Go Trippin'\u201d and \u201cMiserlou\u201d, backed by his band The Del-Tones. Dale said that his trademark rumbling guitar sound was an attempt to replicate the sound of a barrel of a wave. Meanwhile, his father\u2019s Lebanese heritage was a vital influence on Dale\u2019s distinctive lead lines; \u201cMiserlou\u201d was his amped-up take on a Middle Eastern folk song.He influenced artists as diverse as The Beach Boys (who covered \u201cLet\u2019s Go Trippin'\u201d and \u201cMiserlou\u201d on Surfin USA), Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen. Dale enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in the 90s, when Quentin Tarantino chose his version of \u201cMiserlou\u201d as the theme tune for Pulp Fiction.I\u2019m sorry to hear about Dick Dale passing. Dick\u2019s guitar playing was a big influence on all of us, and we covered \u201cMisirlou\u201d on our Surfin\u2019 USA album in \u201863.
