The Ragged Glory was picked from those tracks. The same tracks were never repeated in a recording set, played only once as set\u2026 and the band moved right on to the next song. No repeats. This approach took \u2018analysis\u2019 out of the game during the sessions, allowing the Horse to not think; thinking is deadly for the Horse.\u201cAfter the songs were played enough so that the band was sure they must have the takes, the Horse, having a great time, kept playing other songs\u2026 Five songs, with two versions of one, and one long extended take of another, yielded another 38 minutes of Crazy Horse classics, mostly undiscovered and unheard before.\u201dRagged Glory II will be released as a double LP in vinyl, CD and digital formats \u201cprobably\u201d in 2019 and \u201cpossibly delaying release of other announced projects\u201d \u2013 which could mean another delay for the long-mooted Archives Vol 2 box set. Young has also announced another co-headline show with Bob Dylan, following their July 12 showdown in London\u2019s Hyde Park. The two folk-rock heavyweights will play Nowlan Park, Kilkenny, Ireland on July 14.
